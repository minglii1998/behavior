# Paragraph-level Annotation Guidebook

In this project, we aim to analyze the reasoning process of current large language models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning capabilities, i.e., Large Reasoning Models, LRMs, based on a modified version of Alan Schoenfeld's (1985) "Episode-Timeline" framework for problem-solving. The original Schoenfeld's theory was built on hundreds of hours of recorded tapes of students tackling non-routine math problems while being asked to think aloud. Widely regarded as a gold-standard framework in mathematics-education research, this theory offers a rigorously validated, fine-grained lens for dissecting both expert and novice problem-solving strategies. After thorough investigation, we find that the thinking process of LRMs can be well-aligned with the episodes in the theory, as they also follow similar problem-solving processes. Thus, in this project, we aim to annotate the model (solver) responses with these episode categories. However, to better apply the theory to the analysis of model responses, we apply a hierarchical annotation structure, including paragraph-level annotation and sentence-level annotation. Paragraph-level annotation is used to capture the overall flow of the model response, including **three** categories: General, Explore, and Verify. Sentence-level annotation is used to capture the fine-grained behavior of each sentence, including **seven** categories: Read, Analyze, Plan, Implement, Explore, Verify, and Monitor.

This guidebook provides guidelines for **paragraph-level annotation**. For the given model response paragraphs, each of them will be annotated as one of three broad episode types: General, Explore, or Verify. Please remember, the paragraph-level annotation is used to capture the overall flow of the model response, thus we should take the context into consideration to decide the correct category.

## **Label Definitions and Guidelines**

**1\. General**

* **Definition:** A General episode is a response paragraph where the solver carries out the initial attempt and main line of problem-solving. This category encompasses all general problem-solving actions that are NOT explicitly exploratory trials (Explore) or verification checks (Verify). It typically includes understanding the problem, devising and following a plan, executing solution steps, and making transitions between ideas in a coherent way. In essence, whenever the response is proceeding methodically toward solving the problem (stating facts, applying formulas, deriving results) without digressing into off-plan explorations or checking of results, it falls under a General episode.
* **Guidelines:**  
  * Assign the General label to any paragraph that focuses on *direct progress* toward the solution using established methods or known information. And that progress should not be a part of the verification or exploration process.   
  * This can range from restating the problem in the solver's own words, setting up equations, systematically carrying out computations, to explaining a step-by-step plan. Such paragraphs often appear at the beginning of a solution (interpreting or summarizing the problem), throughout the middle as the solver works through solution steps, or even as concluding statements that present the final answer without explicitly verifying it.   
  * Typically, for the solver response, only the paragraphs for the initial attempt belong to the General category. After the initial attempt, the following paragraphs should be annotated as Explore or Verify.  
  * When differentiating General from other categories, focus on the paragraph's purpose. Given that one paragraph contains several sentences, the General episode might contain sentences that occur from time to time which are considered exploration or verification at the sentence level. However, that exploration or verification is still considered embedded in the General chunk, therefore should be General.  

**2\. Explore**

* **Definition:** An Explore episode is a response paragraph where the solver diverges from the main solution path to investigate possibilities, gather insight, or attempt an approach that isn't guaranteed to work. In Schoenfeld's framework, exploration is a less structured, trial-and-error phase: the solver searches for relevant information or patterns and considers various options without a firm plan. Within a solver response, an Explore paragraph typically reflects the solver's uncertainty or creativity—trying a conjecture, exploring a sub-problem, or experimenting with different strategies. This episode serves to advance understanding when the direct path is unclear, and it often precedes or informs a return to structured problem-solving.   
    
* **Guidelines:**  
  * Use the Explore label for paragraphs where the reasoning is characterized by searching or experimentation rather than executing a known strategy. If the solver poses hypotheses, tests special cases, or temporarily pursues a tangent, that paragraph should be marked Explore.   
  * Common scenarios include: trying a simpler instance of the problem to see how it behaves, guessing a pattern or formula and seeing if it holds, discussing alternative approaches, or brainstorming next steps when stuck. Watch for a *change in tone*—if the paragraph shifts from solving to musing or investigating, it likely represents an exploratory episode.   
  * Since this annotation is at the paragraph level, please only mark the large chunk of an exploration episode toward the solution of the whole question as Explore. If the exploration is only for one step of the solution, it is Explore at the sentence level, therefore not Explore at the paragraph level. For example, in the middle of solving the problem, there is a step for solving 3x=6, which is only a small part of solving the whole problem. In the solution, people explored two different ways of solving the equation, then these are Explore at the sentence level rather than at the paragraph level. Therefore, the tag should be decided carefully depending on whether these steps are a procedure belonging to the initial solution (General), exploration of a new method (Explore), or verification of the answer (Verify).
  * To tell an Explore episode apart from General and Verify, focus on purpose and tone. An Explore paragraph is driven by *uncertainty*: it does not guarantee the solution, but is proactive in providing a new approach to think about or to solve the question. Unlike a General episode, which follows a clear logical step in solving, an Explore episode might temporarily set the main goal aside to answer a sub-question or try a different angle. If the paragraph suggests that the solver is unsure how to proceed and is examining options, that's a strong sign of exploration rather than general solving. Also, Explore is distinct from Verify because it's not primarily about checking a result's correctness. Verify episodes confirm what's believed to be a solution, whereas Explore episodes occur before a solution is confirmed (often before one is even reached). In sum, if the paragraph's content is exploratory (testing, conjecturing, or considering alternatives) and doesn't simply carry out a decided plan or finalize an answer, it should be labeled Explore. 

**3\. Verify**

* **Definition:** A Verify episode is a response paragraph dedicated to confirming the correctness or validity of a solution or a result. In Schoenfeld's terms, a verification episode occurs when the solver "reviews and tests" a solution to ensure it meets the problem requirements. In the context of AI-generated responses, this usually means the paragraph is focused on checking an answer (or an intermediate result) and making sure it is consistent with the conditions of the problem. This episode type often comes at the end of a solution as a final confirmation, but it can also appear mid-solution if the solver pauses to validate a step. The hallmark of a Verify episode is that its primary goal is evaluation: double-checking calculations, substituting the found solution back into the original problem, or logically arguing that the result must be correct.  
    
* **Guidelines:**  
  * Label a paragraph as Verify when the content is centered on checking, confirming, or proving that a result is correct. If the solver explicitly performs a check (for example, plugging the solution back into the original equation to see if it holds, or verifying that all conditions are satisfied), that paragraph should be tagged as Verify.   
  * Do not label a paragraph as Verify if it is merely stating the final answer without checking it; in that case use General for a straightforward conclusion. Only use Verify when actual validation or reasoning about correctness is present.    
  * When a solver launches a *verification routine* (e.g., "To verify…"), every paragraph that belongs to that routine inherits the Verify label, even if later lines contain no overt "checking" words. Mechanical algebra steps, intermediate equations, and the final boxed answer are all part of the same confirmation process, so they are not General.  
  * The key feature that distinguishes a Verify episode is its retrospective nature: it looks back at a result and asks "is this right?" rather than pushing forward to solve something new. This sets it apart from a General episode, which would simply present the result or next step without questioning it. If a paragraph is primarily re-examining what's been done (whether the final answer or a prior step), it is likely to be verification. Compared to an Explore episode, which is uncertain and looking for a way forward, a Verify episode assumes a candidate solution or fact and checks its validity—it is usually certain about what needs to be checked, just not about whether it passes the check. Another way to distinguish Verify is by position and content: a paragraph that comes after an answer has been derived and discusses that answer in light of the problem's conditions is almost always a Verify episode. Be careful not to confuse a final declarative answer (General) with a verification; if there's no evidence of a *checking process* or confirmation language, then it's not truly a Verify episode. The presence of phrases explicitly referencing correctness or fulfilling conditions is the clearest differentiator for Verify.
