        "Response": "Alright, so I need to find all functions \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\) such that whenever \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), then \\( f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\). Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what this condition really means. \n\nFirst, the functional equation has to hold for all integers \\( a, b, c \\) where \\( a + b + c = 0 \\). So, for any three integers that sum to zero, the sum of their function values equals the sum of their squares. That's a pretty strong condition. Maybe I can plug in specific values for \\( a, b, c \\) to figure out the form of \\( f \\).\n\nLet me try some simple cases. Let's set \\( a = b = c = 0 \\). Then \\( 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \\), so the equation becomes \\( f(0) + f(0) + f(0) = 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 \\), which simplifies to \\( 3f(0) = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( f(0) = 0 \\). Okay, that's a start.\n\nNow, let's take two variables to be negatives of each other and the third one to be zero. For example, let \\( c = 0 \\), so \\( a + b = 0 \\), which means \\( b = -a \\). Then the equation becomes \\( f(a) + f(-a) + f(0) = a^2 + (-a)^2 + 0^2 \\). Since \\( f(0) = 0 \\), this simplifies to \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2a^2 \\). So, we have a relation between \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(-a) \\). That's useful. This tells me that the function isn't necessarily even or odd, but their sum is \\( 2a^2 \\).\n\nNext, maybe I can set two variables equal and solve for the third. Let's let \\( a = b = k \\), then \\( c = -2k \\). Plugging into the equation: \\( f(k) + f(k) + f(-2k) = k^2 + k^2 + (-2k)^2 \\). Simplifying, that's \\( 2f(k) + f(-2k) = 2k^2 + 4k^2 = 6k^2 \\). So, \\( 2f(k) + f(-2k) = 6k^2 \\). Hmm. \n\nBut we also have from the previous relation \\( f(-2k) = 2(2k)^2 - f(2k) = 8k^2 - f(2k) \\). Wait, substituting that into the previous equation: \\( 2f(k) + 8k^2 - f(2k) = 6k^2 \\). Then rearranged: \\( 2f(k) - f(2k) = 6k^2 - 8k^2 = -2k^2 \\). So, \\( 2f(k) - f(2k) = -2k^2 \\). Let me write that as \\( f(2k) = 2f(k) + 2k^2 \\). \n\nInteresting. So this relates the function at \\( 2k \\) to the function at \\( k \\). Maybe we can use this recursive relation to find a general form for \\( f(k) \\). Let's suppose that \\( f(k) \\) is a quadratic function. Let me hypothesize that \\( f(k) = ak^2 + bk + c \\). But we already know that \\( f(0) = 0 \\), so substituting \\( k = 0 \\) gives \\( 0 = a*0 + b*0 + c \\), so \\( c = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( f(k) = ak^2 + bk \\). Let's test this.\n\nFirst, let's check the relation \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2a^2 \\). If \\( f(k) = ak^2 + bk \\), then \\( f(-k) = ak^2 - bk \\). Adding them gives \\( 2ak^2 = 2a^2 \\). Wait, but this has to equal \\( 2k^2 \\). Therefore, \\( 2ak^2 = 2k^2 \\), so \\( a = 1 \\). So, the quadratic coefficient is 1. So, \\( f(k) = k^2 + bk \\). Now, let's check the other relation we had: \\( f(2k) = 2f(k) + 2k^2 \\). Let's compute both sides.\n\nLeft-hand side: \\( f(2k) = (2k)^2 + b(2k) = 4k^2 + 2bk \\).\n\nRight-hand side: \\( 2f(k) + 2k^2 = 2(k^2 + bk) + 2k^2 = 2k^2 + 2bk + 2k^2 = 4k^2 + 2bk \\).\n\nSo, both sides are equal. So, this relation holds regardless of the value of \\( b \\). So, the coefficient \\( b \\) is still undetermined. Hmm. Maybe I need another condition to find \\( b \\).\n\nLet me try another substitution. Let me set \\( c = -a - b \\), so the condition \\( a + b + c = 0 \\) is satisfied. Then the equation becomes \\( f(a) + f(b) + f(-a - b) = a^2 + b^2 + (-a - b)^2 \\). Let's compute the right-hand side: \\( a^2 + b^2 + (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab \\). \n\nSo, the equation is \\( f(a) + f(b) + f(-a - b) = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab \\). Let's substitute our current form of \\( f(k) = k^2 + bk \\). Then:\n\nLeft-hand side: \\( (a^2 + ba) + (b^2 + bb) + ((-a - b)^2 + b(-a - b)) \\).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( a^2 + ba \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( b^2 + b^2 \\)? Wait, no. Wait, if \\( f(k) = k^2 + bk \\), then \\( f(b) = b^2 + b*b = b^2 + b^2 = 2b^2 \\)? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, hold on. If \\( f(k) = k^2 + bk \\), then \\( f(b) = b^2 + b*b = b^2 + b^2 = 2b^2 \\). Wait, that would mean \\( f(k) = k^2 + k^2 = 2k^2 \\), but that would imply \\( b = 1 \\). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if \\( f(k) = k^2 + bk \\), then \\( f(b) = b^2 + b*b = b^2 + b^2 = 2b^2 \\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient \\( b \\) in front of the linear term is equal to the variable \\( b \\). That's confusing. Maybe I should use different letters to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me redefine the function as \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\), where \\( d \\) is a constant integer. Then \\( f(a) = a^2 + da \\), \\( f(b) = b^2 + db \\), and \\( f(-a - b) = (-a - b)^2 + d(-a - b) = (a + b)^2 - d(a + b) \\).\n\nSo, substituting into the left-hand side:\n\n\\( f(a) + f(b) + f(-a - b) = (a^2 + da) + (b^2 + db) + ((a + b)^2 - d(a + b)) \\).\n\nExpanding this:\n\nFirst, \\( a^2 + da + b^2 + db + a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - da - db \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( a^2 + a^2 = 2a^2 \\).\n\n\\( b^2 + b^2 = 2b^2 \\).\n\n\\( 2ab \\).\n\n\\( da - da = 0 \\).\n\n\\( db - db = 0 \\).\n\nSo total: \\( 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab \\).\n\nWhich matches the right-hand side. So, regardless of the value of \\( d \\), this equation holds. Wait, that's strange. So even though we have a linear term \\( dk \\), when we plug into the functional equation, the linear terms cancel out. That means the functional equation is satisfied for any linear term? But we also had the previous condition when we set \\( a = b = k \\), leading to the recursive relation, which also didn't restrict \\( d \\). Hmm. So does that mean \\( d \\) can be any integer? But the problem states that \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\). So, as long as \\( d \\) is an integer, the function \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\) would satisfy the condition?\n\nWait, but let's test with specific numbers. Let's take \\( d = 1 \\), so \\( f(k) = k^2 + k \\). Let's check a case. Let me choose \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -1 \\), \\( c = 0 \\). Then \\( f(1) + f(-1) + f(0) = (1 + 1) + (1 - 1) + 0 = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 \\). The right-hand side is \\( 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 \\). That works.\n\nAnother test: \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), \\( c = -5 \\). Then \\( a + b + c = 0 \\). Compute \\( f(2) + f(3) + f(-5) \\). If \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\), then:\n\n\\( f(2) = 4 + 2d \\),\n\n\\( f(3) = 9 + 3d \\),\n\n\\( f(-5) = 25 - 5d \\).\n\nSum: \\( 4 + 2d + 9 + 3d + 25 - 5d = 4 + 9 + 25 + (2d + 3d -5d) = 38 + 0 = 38 \\).\n\nRight-hand side: \\( 2^2 + 3^2 + (-5)^2 = 4 + 9 + 25 = 38 \\). So, that works regardless of \\( d \\). So, does that mean that the function \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\) works for any integer \\( d \\)? \n\nBut the problem says \"find all functions\". So, maybe all such functions are of the form \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\), where \\( d \\) is a constant integer. But let's check another case. Suppose \\( d = 0 \\), then \\( f(k) = k^2 \\). Let me check a different triplet. Let me set \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = -3 \\). Then \\( f(1) + f(2) + f(-3) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 \\). The right-hand side is \\( 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 \\). That works. If \\( d = 5 \\), then \\( f(k) = k^2 + 5k \\). Let's compute \\( f(1) + f(-1) = (1 + 5) + (1 - 5) = 6 - 4 = 2 \\), which is \\( 2*1^2 = 2 \\). That works.\n\nWait, but in our earlier reasoning, we found that \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2a^2 \\). Let's check that with \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\). Then \\( f(a) + f(-a) = (a^2 + da) + (a^2 - da) = 2a^2 \\). Yes, which matches. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut here's the thing: when we derived the relation \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2a^2 \\), that must hold for all \\( a \\), so that gives us a condition on the function. But when we assume \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\), this condition is automatically satisfied regardless of \\( d \\), because the linear terms cancel out. So, the only constraint is from the original functional equation, which also seems to be satisfied for any \\( d \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that \\( f \\) must be a function from \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). So, as long as \\( d \\) is an integer, \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\) will map integers to integers. Therefore, the general solution is \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\), where \\( d \\) is an integer constant. But is that all? Let me check if there are any other possible functions.\n\nWait, maybe we can try to assume that the function has a different form. Suppose, for example, \\( f(k) = k^2 + g(k) \\), where \\( g(k) \\) is some function. Then the functional equation becomes:\n\n\\( (a^2 + g(a)) + (b^2 + g(b)) + (c^2 + g(c)) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\).\n\nSimplifying, this would require \\( g(a) + g(b) + g(c) = 0 \\) whenever \\( a + b + c = 0 \\). So, \\( g \\) must satisfy that for any three integers \\( a, b, c \\) summing to zero, the sum of \\( g(a) + g(b) + g(c) \\) is zero. \n\nThis is a standard type of functional equation. What functions \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\) satisfy \\( g(a) + g(b) + g(c) = 0 \\) whenever \\( a + b + c = 0 \\)? \n\nLet me think. Let's set \\( c = -a - b \\). So, for any \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), \\( g(a) + g(b) + g(-a - b) = 0 \\). \n\nThis resembles a Cauchy-like equation but in three variables. Let's try some substitutions. Let \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( g(0) + g(b) + g(-b) = 0 \\). But we also know from earlier that when we set \\( a = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = 0 \\), so \\( g(0) = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( 0 + g(b) + g(-b) = 0 \\implies g(-b) = -g(b) \\). So, \\( g \\) is an odd function.\n\nNext, let's set \\( b = -a \\). Then \\( a + (-a) + c = 0 \\implies c = 0 \\). So, \\( g(a) + g(-a) + g(0) = 0 \\). But since \\( g(0) = 0 \\), this gives \\( g(a) + g(-a) = 0 \\), which is consistent with \\( g \\) being odd.\n\nAnother substitution: Let \\( b = a \\), then \\( a + a + c = 0 \\implies c = -2a \\). Then, \\( g(a) + g(a) + g(-2a) = 0 \\implies 2g(a) + g(-2a) = 0 \\). Since \\( g \\) is odd, \\( g(-2a) = -g(2a) \\), so \\( 2g(a) - g(2a) = 0 \\implies g(2a) = 2g(a) \\). Therefore, \\( g \\) is homogeneous of degree 1 with respect to scaling by 2. That is, \\( g(2a) = 2g(a) \\).\n\nSimilarly, maybe we can use induction to show that \\( g(ka) = kg(a) \\) for all integers \\( k \\). Let's try to see. Suppose \\( g(2a) = 2g(a) \\). Then, let's try \\( g(3a) \\). Let me set \\( a = a \\), \\( b = a \\), \\( c = -2a \\). Then, \\( g(a) + g(a) + g(-2a) = 0 \\implies 2g(a) - g(2a) = 0 \\), which is already given. Hmm. Alternatively, set \\( a = a \\), \\( b = 2a \\), \\( c = -3a \\). Then, \\( g(a) + g(2a) + g(-3a) = 0 \\). But \\( g(-3a) = -g(3a) \\), so \\( g(a) + 2g(a) - g(3a) = 0 \\implies 3g(a) - g(3a) = 0 \\implies g(3a) = 3g(a) \\). Similarly, proceeding this way, we can show that \\( g(ka) = kg(a) \\) for all integers \\( k \\).\n\nThus, \\( g \\) is a linear function. Since \\( g \\) is additive over the integers and satisfies \\( g(ka) = kg(a) \\), which is the definition of a linear function on integers. The only functions \\( g: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\) that are linear are of the form \\( g(k) = dk \\) for some integer \\( d \\). Because, for integer functions, linearity requires \\( g(k) = g(1) \\cdot k \\). Let me confirm that.\n\nSuppose \\( g \\) is additive: \\( g(a + b) = g(a) + g(b) \\). Then, for integer functions, additive functions are linear. Since \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is a cyclic group generated by 1, so any additive function on \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) must satisfy \\( g(k) = k \\cdot g(1) \\). Let \\( d = g(1) \\). Then, \\( g(k) = dk \\). \n\nBut in our case, \\( g \\) is not just additive, but satisfies the stronger condition \\( g(a) + g(b) + g(-a - b) = 0 \\). However, if \\( g \\) is linear, then \\( g(a) + g(b) + g(-a - b) = da + db + d(-a - b) = 0 \\), which holds. So, all linear functions satisfy this condition, and the only additive functions on \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) are linear. Therefore, \\( g(k) = dk \\) for some integer \\( d \\). Hence, the general solution is \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\), where \\( d \\) is an integer constant.\n\nTherefore, the functions satisfying the given condition are exactly those of the form \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\) for some integer \\( d \\).\n\nWait, but let me verify with another example. Let's take \\( d = 5 \\), so \\( f(k) = k^2 + 5k \\). Let's test \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), \\( c = -3 \\). Then, \\( f(1) + f(2) + f(-3) = (1 + 5) + (4 + 10) + (9 - 15) = 6 + 14 - 6 = 14 \\). The sum of squares is \\( 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 \\). It works.\n\nAnother test: \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = -1 \\), \\( c = -2 \\). Then, \\( f(3) + f(-1) + f(-2) = (9 + 15) + (1 - 5) + (4 - 10) = 24 - 4 - 6 = 14 \\). Sum of squares: \\( 9 + 1 + 4 = 14 \\). It works.\n\nBut wait, what if \\( d \\) is not an integer? For example, if \\( d = 1/2 \\), then \\( f(k) = k^2 + (1/2)k \\), but this doesn't map integers to integers. However, the problem states that \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\), so \\( d \\) must be an integer. Therefore, the only solutions are \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\) where \\( d \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nIs there a possibility of other non-linear functions? Suppose someone tries to add a cubic term. Let's say \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk + ek^3 \\). Then, plugging into the functional equation:\n\n\\( f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = (a^2 + da + ea^3) + (b^2 + db + eb^3) + (c^2 + dc + ec^3) \\).\n\nThis must equal \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\). Therefore, we need:\n\n\\( (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + d(a + b + c) + e(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\).\n\nSince \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), the term \\( d(a + b + c) = 0 \\). So, we need \\( e(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 0 \\).\n\nBut in general, \\( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \\) is not zero when \\( a + b + c = 0 \\). For example, take \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = -2 \\). Then \\( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1 + 1 + (-8) = -6 \\). Therefore, unless \\( e = 0 \\), this term would not vanish. Hence, \\( e \\) must be zero. Therefore, no cubic or higher terms are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if we tried adding a periodic function, like \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk + \\sin(\\pi k) \\), but since we are mapping integers to integers, the sine term would always be zero, so that doesn't help. Any other function that's non-linear would likely interfere with the equation, as shown with the cubic example. Therefore, the only solutions are quadratic functions of the form \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\).\n\nHence, the conclusion is that all such functions are given by \\( f(n) = n^2 + dn \\), where \\( d \\) is a fixed integer. Therefore, the final answer is \\( f(n) = n^2 + dn \\) for some constant \\( d \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe functions satisfying the condition are precisely those of the form \\( \\boxed{f(x) = x^2 + kx} \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer constant.</think>To find all functions \\( f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\) such that whenever \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), then \\( f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\), we start by analyzing specific cases and deriving necessary conditions.\n\n1. **Initial Condition**:\n   - Setting \\( a = b = c = 0 \\), we get \\( 3f(0) = 0 \\), hence \\( f(0) = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Symmetry Condition**:\n   - Setting \\( c = 0 \\) and \\( b = -a \\), we get \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2a^2 \\).\n\n3. **Recursive Relation**:\n   - Setting \\( a = b = k \\) and \\( c = -2k \\), we derive \\( 2f(k) + f(-2k) = 6k^2 \\). Using the symmetry condition, we substitute \\( f(-2k) = 8k^2 - f(2k) \\) to get \\( f(2k) = 2f(k) + 2k^2 \\).\n\n4. **General Form Hypothesis**:\n   - Assuming \\( f(k) \\) is a quadratic function, we propose \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\). This form satisfies the symmetry condition \\( f(a) + f(-a) = 2a^2 \\) and the recursive relation \\( f(2k) = 2f(k) + 2k^2 \\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Substituting \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\) into the functional equation with \\( a + b + c = 0 \\), we verify that the linear terms cancel out, leaving the sum of squares. This confirms the form satisfies the given condition for any integer \\( d \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The functions must be quadratic polynomials of the form \\( f(k) = k^2 + dk \\) where \\( d \\) is an integer. This form is confirmed through various substitutions and verifications, ensuring all conditions are met.\n\nThus, the functions satisfying the condition are precisely those of the form \\( \\boxed{f(x) = x^2 + kx} \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer constant."

I think a decimal terminates if and only if the denominator has prime factors of only 2 and 5, right? So n must be of the form 2^a * 5^b where a and b are non-negative integers. That makes sense because when you have a fraction in its simplest form, if the denominator only has 2s and 5s, then multiplying numerator and denominator by some number will give a power of 10, which makes the decimal terminate. \n\nSo, if n is a positive integer such that 1/n terminates, then n = 2^a * 5^b where a and b are non-negative integers. Therefore, the sum we need to compute is the sum over all a and b of 1/(2^a * 5^b). Since a and b are independent, this should be a double sum: sum_{a=0}^infty sum_{b=0}^infty 1/(2^a * 5^b). \n\nWait, but actually, since each n is uniquely determined by a pair (a, b), we can express the sum as the product of two geometric series. Let me check that. For each prime factor, 2 and 5, the exponents are independent. So the sum over all n with only 2 and 5 as prime factors is equivalent to multiplying the sum over all multiples of 2^a and 5^b. So that would be (sum_{a=0}^infty 1/2^a) * (sum_{b=0}^infty 1/5^b). Is that correct?\n\nYes, because for each a and b, 2^a and 5^b are coprime, so the numbers 2^a * 5^b are all distinct and cover all numbers with prime factors only 2 and 5. Therefore, the total sum is indeed the product of the two geometric series. \n\nCalculating each geometric series: the sum_{a=0}^infty 1/2^a is a geometric series with ratio 1/2. The formula for a geometric series sum is 1/(1 - r) where |r| < 1. So here, sum_{a=0}^infty (1/2)^a = 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2. Similarly, sum_{b=0}^infty (1/5)^b = 1/(1 - 1/5) = 5/4. Therefore, multiplying these two results together: 2 * (5/4) = 10/4 = 5/2. \n\nWait, so the total sum is 5/2? Let me verify this with some examples. Let's list the numbers n which are of the form 2^a *5^b. For a=0, b=0: n=1, 1/1=1.0 (terminates). For a=1, b=0: n=2, 1/2=0.5 (terminates). For a=0, b=1: n=5, 1/5=0.2 (terminates). For a=2, b=0: n=4, 1/4=0.25 (terminates). For a=1, b=1: n=10, 1/10=0.1 (terminates). For a=0, b=2: n=25, 1/25=0.04 (terminates), etc.\n\nIf we start summing these up: 1 + 1/2 + 1/5 + 1/4 + 1/10 + 1/25 + 1/8 + 1/20 + 1/50 + 1/125 + ... Let's compute partial sums and see if they approach 5/2=2.5.\n\nFirst few terms: 1 = 1\n\nAdd 1/2: 1.5\n\nAdd 1/5: 1.5 + 0.2 = 1.7\n\nAdd 1/4: 1.7 + 0.25 = 1.95\n\nAdd 1/10: 1.95 + 0.1 = 2.05\n\nAdd 1/25: 2.05 + 0.04 = 2.09\n\nAdd 1/8: 2.09 + 0.125 = 2.215\n\nAdd 1/20: 2.215 + 0.05 = 2.265\n\nAdd 1/50: 2.265 + 0.02 = 2.285\n\nAdd 1/125: 2.285 + 0.008 = 2.293\n\nAdd 1/16: 2.293 + 0.0625 = 2.3555\n\nAdd 1/40: 2.3555 + 0.025 = 2.3805\n\nAdd 1/100: 2.3805 + 0.01 = 2.3905\n\nAdd 1/250: 2.3905 + 0.004 = 2.3945\n\nAdd 1/625: 2.3945 + 0.0016 = 2.3961\n\nContinuing this, the sum seems to approach closer to 2.5 but very slowly. Wait, 5/2 is 2.5. So even though the partial sums are approaching 2.5, but each term we add is getting smaller and smaller. So theoretically, the infinite sum should converge to 5/2. \n\nBut let me check again the logic. The numbers n with terminating decimals are exactly those with denominators 2^a*5^b. So the sum is over all such n. Since each n is uniquely determined by a and b, the sum is sum_{a=0}^\\infty sum_{b=0}^\\infty 1/(2^a 5^b). Which is the product of two geometric series: sum_{a=0}^\\infty (1/2)^a times sum_{b=0}^\\infty (1/5)^b. Each of these sums is a geometric series with sum 1/(1 - 1/2) = 2 and 1/(1 - 1/5) = 5/4. Multiplying these gives 2 * 5/4 = 5/2. So that's 2.5. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5/2. But wait, let me check again. When we multiply the two series, are we correctly accounting for all combinations? For example, when a=0, b=0: 1 term. Then a=1, b=0; a=0, b=1, etc. Yes, the product of sums does give all combinations. So each term in the product corresponds to a unique pair (a, b), which corresponds to a unique n. Therefore, the total sum is indeed 5/2. \n\nBut let me think if there is a possibility of overlapping terms or something. For example, n=1 is 2^0*5^0, n=2 is 2^1*5^0, n=5 is 2^0*5^1, n=10 is 2^1*5^1, etc. So each n is unique. There is no overlap. So the product of sums is correct. \n\nAnother way to think about this: the sum over all n with prime factors only 2 and 5 is multiplicative. Since the primes 2 and 5 are involved, and their exponents are independent, the sum can be written as the product over each prime's contribution. For prime 2, the sum is 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 2. For prime 5, the sum is 1 + 1/5 + 1/25 + ... = 5/4. Then, since the multiplicative functions, the total sum is 2 * 5/4 = 5/2. \n\nSo, unless I'm missing something here, the answer should be 5/2. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check with another example. Suppose we have numbers that are only powers of 2. The sum is 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 2. Similarly, for numbers that are only powers of 5, the sum is 1 + 1/5 + 1/25 + ... = 5/4. Then, numbers that are products of both 2 and 5 would be covered in the product of these sums. For example, 10 is 2*5, so 1/10 is (1/2)*(1/5). Similarly, 20 is 4*5, so 1/20 is (1/4)*(1/5), etc. So multiplying the two sums gives all possible combinations. Therefore, the logic is correct. \n\nHence, the total sum is indeed 5/2. Therefore, the answer is 5/2, which is 2.5. So in box form, \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{2}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{2}}</think>To find the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) over all positive integers \\(n\\) such that the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) terminates, we note that a decimal terminates if and only if the denominator (in its simplest form) has prime factors only 2 and 5.

        "Response": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of f(k) from k=2 to infinity, where f(k) is defined as the sum from j=2 to 2008 of 1/(j^k). So f(k) is like 1/2^k + 1/3^k + ... + 1/2008^k, right? And then I have to sum that from k=2 all the way to infinity. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down what exactly the problem is asking. The sum they want is:\n\nSum_{k=2}^{\u221e} [Sum_{j=2}^{2008} 1/(j^k)]\n\nSo, that's a double sum. The inner sum is over j from 2 to 2008, and the outer sum is over k from 2 to infinity. Maybe I can switch the order of summation? Because sometimes switching the order makes things easier. Let me check if that's possible here.\n\nIf I switch the order, the sum becomes:\n\nSum_{j=2}^{2008} [Sum_{k=2}^{\u221e} 1/(j^k)]\n\nRight? Because for each j, we're summing over all k from 2 to infinity. So instead of summing over k first and then j, I sum over j first and then k. That seems valid because all terms are positive, so by Tonelli's theorem, we can interchange the order of summation. Okay, good. So now the problem reduces to computing, for each j from 2 to 2008, the sum from k=2 to infinity of 1/(j^k). Then sum all those up.\n\nSo, let's focus on the inner sum: Sum_{k=2}^{\u221e} 1/(j^k). That's a geometric series, isn't it? Because each term is (1/j)^k, starting from k=2. The standard geometric series formula is Sum_{k=0}^{\u221e} r^k = 1/(1 - r) for |r| < 1. But here, our series starts at k=2, not k=0. So, how do we adjust for that?\n\nWell, the sum from k=2 to infinity of r^k is equal to the sum from k=0 to infinity of r^k minus the first two terms (k=0 and k=1). So:\n\nSum_{k=2}^{\u221e} r^k = Sum_{k=0}^{\u221e} r^k - r^0 - r^1 = 1/(1 - r) - 1 - r\n\nIn our case, r is 1/j, right? Because each term is (1/j)^k. So substituting r = 1/j, we get:\n\nSum_{k=2}^{\u221e} (1/j)^k = 1/(1 - 1/j) - 1 - (1/j)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 1/(1 - 1/j) is the same as j/(j - 1). Then subtract 1 and 1/j:\n\nj/(j - 1) - 1 - 1/j = [j/(j - 1) - 1] - 1/j\n\nLet me compute j/(j - 1) - 1. That's [j - (j - 1)]/(j - 1) = [1]/(j - 1). So then subtract 1/j:\n\n1/(j - 1) - 1/j\n\nSo combining those terms:\n\n1/(j - 1) - 1/j = [j - (j - 1)] / [j(j - 1)] = [1]/[j(j - 1)]\n\nWait, that seems right. Let me verify:\n\nYes, 1/(j - 1) - 1/j = (j - (j - 1))/[j(j - 1)] = 1/[j(j - 1)]\n\nSo, the sum from k=2 to infinity of 1/j^k is equal to 1/[j(j - 1)]\n\nThat's a nice simplification. So for each j from 2 to 2008, the inner sum is 1/(j(j - 1)). Therefore, the total sum we need is the sum from j=2 to 2008 of 1/(j(j - 1)).\n\nOkay, so now the problem reduces to computing Sum_{j=2}^{2008} 1/(j(j - 1)). That seems manageable. Maybe this is a telescoping series?\n\nRecall that 1/(j(j - 1)) can be written as 1/(j - 1) - 1/j. Let me check:\n\n1/(j - 1) - 1/j = [j - (j - 1)] / [j(j - 1)] = 1/[j(j - 1)], which matches. So yes, we can express each term as a telescoping difference.\n\nTherefore, the sum from j=2 to 2008 of [1/(j - 1) - 1/j] is equal to [1/1 - 1/2] + [1/2 - 1/3] + ... + [1/2007 - 1/2008]. When we add these up, all the intermediate terms cancel out, and we're left with the first term of the first expression minus the last term of the last expression. So:\n\nSum_{j=2}^{2008} [1/(j - 1) - 1/j] = 1 - 1/2008\n\nBecause the first term is 1/1 (when j=2, j-1=1), and the last term is -1/2008. All the terms in between cancel.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is 1 - 1/2008 = 2007/2008.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSum_{k=2}^{\u221e} f(k) = Sum_{j=2}^{2008} [Sum_{k=2}^{\u221e} 1/j^k] = Sum_{j=2}^{2008} 1/(j(j - 1)) = 2007/2008\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2007/2008.\n\nWait, let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Start with the original problem: sum from k=2 to infinity of f(k), where f(k) is the sum from j=2 to 2008 of 1/j^k.\n\n2. Interchange the order of summation: sum over j first, then k. Which gives sum over j of sum over k of 1/j^k.\n\n3. For each j, compute sum from k=2 to infinity of 1/j^k. Recognize this as a geometric series starting at k=2. Then use the formula for the geometric series starting at k=0 and subtract the first two terms.\n\n4. Calculate that sum as 1/(j(j - 1)).\n\n5. Then sum over j=2 to 2008 of 1/(j(j - 1)), which telescopes to 1 - 1/2008.\n\nAll steps seem valid. The key steps were interchanging the order of summation, recognizing the geometric series, and then telescoping the resulting sum. Seems solid.\n\nLet me just check with a smaller example to see if the logic holds. Suppose instead of j from 2 to 2008, let's take j from 2 to 3, and compute the sum over k=2 to infinity of [1/2^k + 1/3^k]. Then according to the formula, it should be [1/(2*1) + 1/(3*2)] = 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3. Let's compute it directly.\n\nSum_{k=2}^\u221e 1/2^k = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... = (1/4)/(1 - 1/2) = 1/2\n\nSum_{k=2}^\u221e 1/3^k = 1/9 + 1/27 + ... = (1/9)/(1 - 1/3) = 1/6\n\nSo total sum is 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3, which matches 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. Because in this case, j goes up to 3, so 1 - 1/3 = 2/3. So the telescoping works here. Hence, the method is correct.\n\nTherefore, confident that the answer is 2007/2008.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{2007}{2008}}</think>To find the sum \\(\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} f(k)\\) where \\(f(r) = \\sum_{j=2}^{2008} \\frac{1}{j^r}\\), we start by interchanging the order of summation:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} f(k) = \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{j=2}^{2008} \\frac{1}{j^k} = \\sum_{j=2}^{2008} \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j^k}\n\\]\n\nFor each fixed \\(j\\), the inner sum \\(\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{j^k}\\) is a geometric series starting at \\(k=2\\).

        "Response": "Okay, so we have five students playing chess matches against each other. Each student plays three matches against each of the other students. I need to figure out how many matches are played in total. Let me try to work this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's think about how many pairs of students there are. Since each student plays against every other student, it's a combination problem. For five students, the number of unique pairs can be calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. Here, n is 5 students and k is 2 since a match involves two students. So, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (2 * 1 * 3!) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10. So, there are 10 unique pairs of students.\n\nBut wait, each pair plays three matches against each other. So, for each of these 10 pairs, there are three matches. Therefore, the total number of matches would be 10 pairs multiplied by 3 matches per pair. That would be 10 * 3 = 30 matches. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me verify to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when counting matches or games, people might make the mistake of double-counting. Let's see. If I approach it from each student's perspective: each student plays three matches against each of the other four students. So, per student, that's 3 * 4 = 12 matches. Then, with five students, that would be 5 * 12 = 60. But wait, that counts each match twice because when Student A plays Student B, it's one match from A's perspective and another from B's perspective. So, to get the actual number, we need to divide by 2. Therefore, 60 / 2 = 30. Okay, that confirms the previous answer of 30 matches.\n\nSo both methods lead to 30. That seems consistent. Let me think if there's another way to approach this or if there's a potential pitfall I didn't consider.\n\nAnother way to think about it: imagine scheduling the matches. Each pair has three matches, so for each pair, you can think of them playing three different games. Since there are 10 pairs (as calculated earlier), each contributing three games, total games are 10 * 3 = 30. Yeah, that's the same as before.\n\nIs there a possibility that the problem is trying to trick us? For example, sometimes problems might mention rounds or something, but here it's straightforward: each student plays three matches against each other student. So, no, each pair just plays three times, so total is 3 times the number of pairs.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said each student plays three matches total, that would be different. But it says three matches against each of the other students. So per opponent, three matches, which is different.\n\nSo, Student A plays 3 matches vs B, 3 vs C, 3 vs D, and 3 vs E. That's 12 matches for Student A. Similarly, Student B has already played 3 against A, and then needs to play 3 against C, D, E. But when we count all students, we have 5 students each with 12 matches, but each match is between two students, so total is indeed (5 * 12)/2 = 30.\n\nAlternatively, if we tried to list all matches, it would be tedious, but let's consider a smaller case. Suppose there are 2 students: each plays 3 matches against the other. So total matches: 3. If there are 3 students: each pair plays 3 matches. There are C(3,2)=3 pairs. So total matches 3*3=9. Checking via the other method: each student plays 3 matches against each of 2 others, so 3*2=6 matches per student, 3 students *6=18, divided by 2 gives 9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula works here. Hence, for 5 students, the answer is 30. So I think that's solid.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Suppose we list all possible matches. Each match is between two distinct students, and each such pair has three matches. So the total number of matches is the number of unordered pairs multiplied by three. Since the number of unordered pairs in five students is C(5,2)=10, as calculated before. So 10*3=30. Yep, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, ordered pairs: if we consider ordered pairs, there are 5*4=20 ordered pairs (since for each student, there are 4 others). But each unordered pair corresponds to two ordered pairs (A vs B and B vs A). But in chess matches, a match between A and B is the same as B and A, right? So if they play three matches, it's three instances of A vs B, regardless of order. So we don't need to consider order here. So unordered pairs, times three. Hence, 10*3=30.\n\nAlternatively, if order did matter, like if playing at home and away, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It's just three matches against each other, so order doesn't matter. So total matches are 30.\n\nTherefore, after considering multiple approaches and verifying with smaller numbers, I'm confident the total number of matches is 30.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of matches played is \\boxed{30}.</think>To determine the total number of chess matches played by five students, where each student plays three matches against each of the other students, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of unique pairs of students**: This is a combination problem where we need to choose 2 students out of 5.

        "Response": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the infinite sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^{4}+4}\\). Hmm, infinite series can be tricky, but maybe there's a way to simplify the general term here. Let me think... The denominator is \\(n^4 + 4\\). That looks similar to a quadratic in terms of \\(n^2\\), but it's a quartic. Wait, sometimes these expressions can be factored. Maybe I can factor \\(n^4 + 4\\) into something more manageable. \n\nI remember that \\(a^4 + b^4\\) can be factored as \\((a^2 + \\sqrt{2}ab + b^2)(a^2 - \\sqrt{2}ab + b^2)\\), but here we have \\(n^4 + 4\\), which is \\(n^4 + 4 = n^4 + 4n^0\\). Hmm, maybe a different factoring technique. Oh! There's a formula for the sum of squares: \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) can be factored as \\((a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\). Let me check if that works here.\n\nIf I set \\(b = 1\\), then \\(a^4 + 4(1)^4 = a^4 + 4\\), so yes! So substituting \\(a = n\\), since our term is \\(n^4 + 4\\), then \\(n^4 + 4 = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\\). Let me verify that:\n\nMultiply \\((n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\(n^2 \\times n^2 = n^4\\).\n\nThen \\(n^2 \\times (-2n) = -2n^3\\), and \\(n^2 \\times 2 = 2n^2\\).\n\nNext, \\(2n \\times n^2 = 2n^3\\), \\(2n \\times (-2n) = -4n^2\\), \\(2n \\times 2 = 4n\\).\n\nThen, \\(2 \\times n^2 = 2n^2\\), \\(2 \\times (-2n) = -4n\\), \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\).\n\nAdd all those terms together:\n\n\\(n^4 -2n^3 + 2n^2 + 2n^3 -4n^2 +4n +2n^2 -4n +4\\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(n^4\\)\n\n- \\(-2n^3 + 2n^3 = 0\\)\n\n- \\(2n^2 -4n^2 +2n^2 = 0\\)\n\n- \\(4n -4n = 0\\)\n\n- Constant term: 4\n\nWait, so that gives \\(n^4 + 4\\). Perfect! So the factorization works. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\nn^4 + 4 = (n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\nSo the term \\(\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4}\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)}\\). Now, maybe this can be expressed using partial fractions. Let's try that.\n\nLet me set up partial fractions. Let:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\frac{An + B}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\frac{Cn + D}{n^2 - 2n + 2}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\((n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\\) to get:\n\n\\[\nn = (An + B)(n^2 - 2n + 2) + (Cn + D)(n^2 + 2n + 2)\n\\]\n\nNow, expand the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, expand \\((An + B)(n^2 - 2n + 2)\\):\n\n\\(An \\times n^2 = A n^3\\)\n\n\\(An \\times (-2n) = -2A n^2\\)\n\n\\(An \\times 2 = 2A n\\)\n\n\\(B \\times n^2 = B n^2\\)\n\n\\(B \\times (-2n) = -2B n\\)\n\n\\(B \\times 2 = 2B\\)\n\nSimilarly, expand \\((Cn + D)(n^2 + 2n + 2)\\):\n\n\\(Cn \\times n^2 = C n^3\\)\n\n\\(Cn \\times 2n = 2C n^2\\)\n\n\\(Cn \\times 2 = 2C n\\)\n\n\\(D \\times n^2 = D n^2\\)\n\n\\(D \\times 2n = 2D n\\)\n\n\\(D \\times 2 = 2D\\)\n\nSo combining all these terms:\n\nLeft side: \\(n\\)\n\nRight side:\n\n- \\(A n^3 + C n^3 = (A + C) n^3\\)\n\n- \\(-2A n^2 + B n^2 + 2C n^2 + D n^2 = (-2A + B + 2C + D) n^2\\)\n\n- \\(2A n - 2B n + 2C n + 2D n = (2A - 2B + 2C + 2D) n\\)\n\n- Constants: \\(2B + 2D\\)\n\nTherefore, equating coefficients on both sides:\n\nFor \\(n^3\\): \\(A + C = 0\\) (since there's no \\(n^3\\) term on the left)\n\nFor \\(n^2\\): \\(-2A + B + 2C + D = 0\\) (no \\(n^2\\) term on the left)\n\nFor \\(n\\): \\(2A - 2B + 2C + 2D = 1\\) (coefficient of \\(n\\) on left is 1)\n\nFor constants: \\(2B + 2D = 0\\) (no constant term on left)\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. \\(A + C = 0\\)\n\n2. \\(-2A + B + 2C + D = 0\\)\n\n3. \\(2A - 2B + 2C + 2D = 1\\)\n\n4. \\(2B + 2D = 0\\)\n\nLet me solve this step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(C = -A\\)\n\nFrom equation 4: \\(2B + 2D = 0\\) => \\(B = -D\\)\n\nLet me substitute \\(C = -A\\) and \\(B = -D\\) into equations 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2: \\(-2A + (-D) + 2(-A) + D = 0\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(-2A - D - 2A + D = (-2A - 2A) + (-D + D) = -4A = 0\\)\n\nThus, \\(-4A = 0\\) => \\(A = 0\\)\n\nThen, since \\(C = -A = 0\\), and from equation 4, \\(B = -D\\). Now, substitute \\(A = 0\\) and \\(C = 0\\) into equation 3:\n\nEquation 3: \\(2(0) - 2B + 2(0) + 2D = 1\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(-2B + 2D = 1\\)\n\nBut since \\(B = -D\\), substitute:\n\n\\(-2(-D) + 2D = 2D + 2D = 4D = 1\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(4D = 1\\) => \\(D = 1/4\\)\n\nThen, \\(B = -D = -1/4\\)\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n\\(A = 0\\), \\(C = 0\\), \\(B = -1/4\\), \\(D = 1/4\\)\n\nTherefore, the partial fractions decomposition is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{(n^2 + 2n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 2)} = \\frac{0 \\cdot n - 1/4}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\frac{0 \\cdot n + 1/4}{n^2 - 2n + 2} = \\frac{-1/4}{n^2 + 2n + 2} + \\frac{1/4}{n^2 - 2n + 2}\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2 - 2n + 2} - \\frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nHmm, that looks promising. So the original sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 + 4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2 - 2n + 2} - \\frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 2} \\right )\n\\]\n\nThis seems like a telescoping series! Because if we can write the terms as differences of consecutive terms, then the sum might collapse. Let me check.\n\nBut wait, telescoping usually requires the terms to be consecutive in some index. Let's look at the denominators:\n\nFirst term: \\(n^2 - 2n + 2\\). Let's complete the square:\n\n\\(n^2 - 2n + 1 + 1 = (n - 1)^2 + 1\\)\n\nSecond term: \\(n^2 + 2n + 2\\). Completing the square:\n\n\\(n^2 + 2n + 1 + 1 = (n + 1)^2 + 1\\)\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{(n - 1)^2 + 1} - \\frac{1}{(n + 1)^2 + 1} \\right )\n\\]\n\nAh! Now this looks like a telescoping series. Let's consider the general term:\n\nFor each \\(n\\), we have \\(\\frac{1}{(n - 1)^2 + 1}\\) minus \\(\\frac{1}{(n + 1)^2 + 1}\\). Let's write out the first few terms to see the cancellation.\n\nFor \\(n = 1\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{(0)^2 + 1} - \\frac{1}{(2)^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{5}\\)\n\nFor \\(n = 2\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{(1)^2 + 1} - \\frac{1}{(3)^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{10}\\)\n\nFor \\(n = 3\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{(2)^2 + 1} - \\frac{1}{(4)^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{17}\\)\n\nFor \\(n = 4\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{(3)^2 + 1} - \\frac{1}{(5)^2 + 1} = \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{26}\\)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, when we add these up, let's see the partial sum up to N:\n\nSum from \\(n=1\\) to N:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{17} + \\frac{1}{10} - \\frac{1}{26} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{(N - 1)^2 + 1} - \\frac{1}{(N + 1)^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\nNotice that terms start canceling. The \\(-1/5\\) from \\(n=1\\) cancels with the \\(+1/5\\) from \\(n=3\\). Similarly, the \\(-1/10\\) from \\(n=2\\) cancels with the \\(+1/10\\) from \\(n=4\\). This pattern continues, so most terms cancel out, leaving only the early terms that don't have counterparts to cancel.\n\nSpecifically, after cancellation, the partial sum up to N is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{(N)^2 + 1} - \\frac{1}{(N + 1)^2 + 1}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let's see:\n\nFor the first few terms, when N=1:\n\nSum = \\(1/1 - 1/5\\). So partial sum: 1 - 1/5.\n\nFor N=2:\n\nSum = (1 -1/5) + (1/2 -1/10) = 1 +1/2 -1/5 -1/10.\n\nFor N=3:\n\nAdd (1/5 -1/17) to previous: 1 +1/2 -1/10 -1/17.\n\nWait, so actually, the cancellation is not symmetric. Let me track it more carefully.\n\nEach term \\(\\frac{1}{(n -1)^2 +1}\\) will cancel with a term two steps ahead. For example, the term from n=1: \\(\\frac{1}{0^2 +1}\\) is unique. Then the term from n=2: \\(\\frac{1}{1^2 +1}\\) is also unique until n=3, which has a term \\(\\frac{1}{2^2 +1}\\). Wait, no, when n=3, the first part is \\(\\frac{1}{2^2 +1}\\), which would be the same as n=3's first term? Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the first part of each term is \\(\\frac{1}{(n-1)^2 +1}\\), so if we shift the index on that part.\n\nLet me consider shifting the index for the first part. Let k = n -1. Then when n=1, k=0: \\(\\frac{1}{0^2 +1}\\). When n=2, k=1: \\(\\frac{1}{1^2 +1}\\), etc. Similarly, the second part is \\(-\\frac{1}{(n+1)^2 +1}\\), so if we let m = n +1, then when n=1, m=2: \\(-\\frac{1}{2^2 +1}\\), when n=2, m=3: \\(-\\frac{1}{3^2 +1}\\), etc.\n\nTherefore, the sum can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{(n -1)^2 +1} - \\frac{1}{(n +1)^2 +1} \\right ) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2 +1} - \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2 +1}\n\\]\n\nBecause when n starts at 1, k starts at 0, and m starts at 2. Therefore, the entire sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{0^2 +1} + \\frac{1}{1^2 +1} + \\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2 +1} \\right ) - \\left( \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2 +1} \\right )\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2 +1} - \\sum_{m=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^2 +1} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nBecause the sums from k=2 to infinity cancel out. Therefore, the total sum is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nBut remember, our original sum had a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in front. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^4 +4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}\n\\]\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm this. Because when I shifted the indices, the sum becomes:\n\nSum from k=0 to infinity of 1/(k\u00b2 +1) minus sum from m=2 to infinity of 1/(m\u00b2 +1). Therefore, the difference is sum from k=0 to 1 of 1/(k\u00b2 +1), which is 1/(0 +1) + 1/(1 +1) = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. So that's correct.\n\nHence, the original sum is (1/4)*(3/2) = 3/8. Therefore, the answer should be 3/8.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Let me compute partial sums numerically to see if it converges to 3/8.\n\nCompute the first few terms:\n\nTerm n=1: 1/(1 +4) = 1/5 = 0.2\n\nTerm n=2: 2/(16 +4) = 2/20 = 0.1\n\nTerm n=3: 3/(81 +4) = 3/85 \u2248 0.035294\n\nTerm n=4: 4/(256 +4) = 4/260 \u2248 0.015385\n\nTerm n=5: 5/(625 +4) = 5/629 \u2248 0.007949\n\nAdding these up: 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3; +0.035294 \u2248 0.335294; +0.015385 \u2248 0.350679; +0.007949 \u2248 0.358628\n\nNow, 3/8 is 0.375. So after 5 terms, we have ~0.3586. Let's compute a few more:\n\nTerm n=6: 6/(1296 +4) = 6/1300 \u2248 0.004615\n\nSum \u2248 0.3586 + 0.004615 \u2248 0.363215\n\nn=7: 7/(2401 +4) = 7/2405 \u2248 0.002910\n\nSum \u2248 0.363215 + 0.002910 \u2248 0.366125\n\nn=8: 8/(4096 +4) = 8/4100 \u2248 0.001951\n\nSum \u2248 0.366125 + 0.001951 \u2248 0.368076\n\nn=9: 9/(6561 +4) = 9/6565 \u2248 0.001371\n\nSum \u2248 0.368076 + 0.001371 \u2248 0.369447\n\nn=10:10/(10000 +4)=10/10004\u22480.0009996\n\nSum\u22480.369447 +0.0009996\u22480.370446\n\nSo after 10 terms, we're at approximately 0.3704, which is still less than 0.375. Let's check n=20:\n\nTerm n=20:20/(160000 +4)=20/160004\u22480.000125\n\nSum would be approaching 0.375 as n increases. Since the terms are positive and decreasing, the partial sums should approach the limit from below.\n\nAlternatively, using the telescoping sum expression, the partial sum up to N is:\n\n(1/4)[ (1 + 1/2 - 1/(N\u00b2 +1) -1/((N+1)^2 +1) ]\n\nSo as N approaches infinity, the terms 1/(N\u00b2 +1) and 1/((N+1)^2 +1) go to zero. Therefore, the sum converges to (1/4)(1 + 1/2) = 3/8 = 0.375. So yes, this makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the infinite sum is 3/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}}</think>To evaluate the infinite sum \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{n^{4}+4}\\), we start by factoring the denominator \\(n^4 + 4\\).

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, a monotone sequence means it's either non-decreasing or non-increasing. Since the numbers are distinct, it's strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. But since arithmetic progressions are about differences, whether it's increasing or decreasing shouldn't matter, right? Because an AP in a decreasing sequence is just a reversed AP in an increasing sequence. So maybe I can just consider increasing sequences without loss of generality.\n\nA three-term arithmetic progression is a sequence of three numbers a, b, c such that b - a = c - b, which simplifies to 2b = a + c. So in other words, the middle term is the average of the first and third terms. So given a sorted sequence, I need to count how many such triplets exist where the middle term is exactly the average of the other two.\n\nMy goal is to maximize this count. So I need to arrange the sequence in such a way that there are as many such triplets as possible. But wait, the sequence is monotone and consists of distinct reals. So maybe the way to maximize the number of APs is to have as many evenly spaced numbers as possible? Because in an evenly spaced sequence (like an arithmetic progression itself), every triplet that is equally spaced forms an AP. But if the entire sequence is an arithmetic progression, then the number of three-term APs would be (n-2 choose 1) because every consecutive triplet is an AP, but actually, in a full arithmetic progression, any three equally spaced terms form an AP. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nIn a standard arithmetic progression, say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then the three-term APs are 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; but also 1,3,5. So actually, there are more APs than just the consecutive ones. So in general, for a sequence of length n which is itself an arithmetic progression, how many three-term APs does it contain?\n\nLet me see. For each possible common difference d, but since the entire sequence is an arithmetic progression with fixed difference d, then any three terms that are equally spaced will form an AP. So the number of three-term APs in the full arithmetic progression is equal to the number of ways to choose three terms such that the middle term is the average of the first and third.\n\nIn the case of the full AP, the number of such triplets is the number of pairs of terms that are symmetric around some middle term. For each middle term, how many pairs are symmetric around it? For a term at position i (1-based index), the number of pairs symmetric around it would be the minimum of i - 1 and n - i. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think with an example.\n\nTake n = 5: positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nFor the middle term at position 3: the pairs are (1,5), (2,4). So 2 pairs.\n\nFor position 2: the only possible pair is (1,3).\n\nFor position 4: the only possible pair is (3,5).\n\nFor positions 1 and 5: no pairs.\n\nSo total number of three-term APs: for position 3: 2, positions 2 and 4: 1 each. So total 4.\n\nBut wait, in the sequence 1,2,3,4,5, the three-term APs are:\n\n1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 1,3,5. That's 4, which matches.\n\nSo in general, for a full arithmetic progression of length n, the number of three-term APs is (n - 2) + (n - 4) + ... depending on whether n is odd or even. Wait, no. Wait, in the n=5 case, it's 4. For n=4, let's see: sequence 1,2,3,4.\n\nThree-term APs: 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 1,2,3 (wait, but 1,3,5 isn't there). Wait, n=4: 1,2,3,4.\n\nAPs: 1,2,3; 2,3,4; and 1,2,3 (with difference 1), and 1,3,5 isn't present. Wait, no. In n=4, the APs are:\n\n1,2,3; 2,3,4; and 1,2,3 (no, that's same as first). Wait, maybe only 1,2,3; 2,3,4; and 1,3,5 isn't there because 5 isn't in the sequence. So for n=4, two three-term APs. Wait, but according to the previous method, for each position:\n\nPosition 2: pair (1,3)\n\nPosition 3: pair (2,4)\n\nPositions 1 and 4: no pairs.\n\nSo total 2 three-term APs. So in general, for a full arithmetic progression of length n, the number of three-term APs is (n - 2) + (n - 4) + ... until we reach 0 or 1. Wait, no, actually, for each middle term at position i (from 2 to n-1), the number of APs centered at i is min(i - 1, n - i). So the total number is sum_{i=2}^{n-1} min(i - 1, n - i).\n\nWait, let's test this formula for n=5:\n\nsum from i=2 to 4 of min(i -1, 5 - i):\n\ni=2: min(1,3) =1\n\ni=3: min(2,2)=2\n\ni=4: min(3,1)=1\n\nTotal sum:1+2+1=4, which matches.\n\nFor n=4:\n\ni=2: min(1, 2)=1\n\ni=3: min(2,1)=1\n\nTotal sum:1+1=2, which matches.\n\nSo in general, for a full arithmetic progression, the number of three-term APs is sum_{i=1}^{n-2} min(i, n - 1 - i). Wait, maybe another way. Let's note that the number of three-term APs in a full AP sequence is equal to the number of pairs of terms that are equidistant from some term. For each term, the number of such pairs is the number of terms to the left times the number of terms to the right. Wait, no. For each term, if there are k terms to the left and k terms to the right, then the number of pairs symmetric around that term is k. For example, if a term has m terms on the left and m terms on the right, then there are m possible pairs. If the numbers are unequal, then it's the minimum of left and right.\n\nBut actually, in a full AP, you can have any pair (a, c) such that (a + c)/2 is also in the sequence. So the total number of such triplets is equal to the number of pairs (a, c) where a < c and (a + c)/2 is in the sequence. So for the full AP, this is equivalent to choosing any two terms with an even distance apart? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn the full AP, for any two terms a_i and a_j (i < j), the average (a_i + a_j)/2 is equal to a_{(i + j)/2} if (i + j) is even. So in order for (a_i + a_j)/2 to be present in the sequence, (i + j) must be even, meaning that the indices are both odd or both even, so their sum is even. Therefore, the number of such pairs is equal to the number of pairs of indices i < j such that (i + j) is even. For each such pair, there is a corresponding middle term a_{(i + j)/2}.\n\nTherefore, the number of three-term APs in the full AP sequence is equal to the number of pairs of indices with even sum. How many such pairs are there?\n\nIn a sequence of length n, the number of pairs with even sum can be calculated as follows: Let\u2019s denote m = floor(n/2), k = ceil(n/2). Then the number of pairs where both indices are even or both are odd. The number of even indices is m, the number of odd indices is k. So the total number is C(m, 2) + C(k, 2).\n\nWait, for example, if n is even, say n=4. Then m = 2 even indices (2,4), k=2 odd indices (1,3). So C(2,2) + C(2,2) =1 +1=2, which matches our previous result.\n\nIf n=5, then m=2 even indices (2,4), k=3 odd indices (1,3,5). So C(2,2)+C(3,2)=1 +3=4, which matches the n=5 case.\n\nSo in general, the number of three-term APs in a full arithmetic progression of length n is C(ceil(n/2), 2) + C(floor(n/2), 2). Which simplifies to:\n\nIf n is even: n = 2m, then ceil(n/2) = floor(n/2) = m. So total is 2*C(m,2) = 2*(m(m -1)/2) = m(m -1).\n\nIf n is odd: n = 2m +1, then ceil(n/2)=m +1, floor(n/2)=m. So total is C(m +1, 2) + C(m, 2) = [ (m +1)m /2 ] + [ m(m -1)/2 ] = [ m^2 + m + m^2 - m ] / 2 = (2m^2)/2 = m^2.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- If n is even: (n/2 -1)(n/2)\n- If n is odd: ((n -1)/2)^2\n\nBut let's write that in terms of n:\n\nFor even n = 2m: (m -1)m = (n/2 -1)(n/2) = n(n - 2)/4\n\nFor odd n = 2m +1: m\u00b2 = ((n -1)/2)^2 = (n -1)^2 /4\n\nSo in general, the number of three-term APs in a full arithmetic progression is floor((n -1)^2 /4). Wait, let's check:\n\nFor n even: n(n -2)/4 = (n\u00b2 -2n)/4\n\nFor n odd: (n -1)^2 /4\n\nBut floor((n -1)^2 /4) for even n: (n -1)^2 /4 = (2m -1)^2 /4 = (4m\u00b2 -4m +1)/4 = m\u00b2 -m + 0.25, so floor is m\u00b2 -m, which is equal to m(m -1) = n(n -2)/4. So yes, both cases can be written as floor((n -1)^2 /4). Wait, but n(n -2)/4 for even n is equal to m(m -1) where m =n/2, and (n -1)^2 /4 for odd n is ((2m +1)-1)^2 /4 = (2m)^2 /4 = m\u00b2. So indeed, the number is floor((n -1)^2 /4). For even n, (n -1)^2 /4 is not integer, but floor gives the correct integer. For example, n=4: (4 -1)^2 /4 =9/4=2.25, floor is 2, which is equal to 4*2/4=2. For n=5: (5 -1)^2 /4=16/4=4, which matches.\n\nSo the number of three-term APs in a full arithmetic progression is floor((n -1)^2 /4). Hmm, interesting. So if we have a sequence that is an arithmetic progression, that gives this number of three-term APs. The question is, can we have a monotone sequence (not necessarily an AP) that has more three-term APs? Or is the maximum achieved by the full AP?\n\nIntuitively, I might think that the maximum number is achieved when the sequence is an arithmetic progression, because that's the most regular structure, allowing for the most triplets to form APs. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arranging the sequence in a way that has multiple overlapping APs could create more. For example, if the sequence has several clusters of APs, maybe that could increase the count. But since the sequence is strictly monotonic, you can't have repeats, so clusters would have to be spaced apart. But perhaps overlapping APs could give more?\n\nWait, let me think of a small example. Take n=4. If the sequence is an AP, like 1,2,3,4. Then the three-term APs are 1,2,3 and 2,3,4, so two APs.\n\nBut what if the sequence is 1,2,4,5. Then let's see: 1,2,4: 2 -1 =1, 4 -2=2, not AP. 2,4,5: 4 -2=2, 5 -4=1, not AP. 1,4,5: 4 -1=3, 5 -4=1, not AP. 1,2,5: 2 -1=1, 5 -2=3, not AP. So only one three-term AP: 1,2,3 is not present. Wait, actually, in this sequence, there are no three-term APs? That can't be. Wait, 1,2,4,5. Let's check all triplets:\n\n1,2,4: differences 1 and 2, not AP.\n\n1,2,5: differences 1 and 3, not AP.\n\n1,4,5: differences 3 and 1, not AP.\n\n2,4,5: differences 2 and 1, not AP.\n\nSo actually, this sequence has no three-term APs. So that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1,3,5,7. That's an AP, and has three-term APs: 1,3,5; 3,5,7; and 1,5,9 (but 9 isn't in the sequence). So only two APs, same as the previous AP.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I take 1,2,3,5. Let's check triplets:\n\n1,2,3: AP.\n\n1,2,5: differences 1 and 3.\n\n1,3,5: differences 2 and 2: AP.\n\n2,3,5: differences 1 and 2.\n\nSo here, there are two APs: 1,2,3 and 1,3,5. So same as the full AP.\n\nWait, so even though the sequence isn't a full AP, it still has two three-term APs. So in this case, same number.\n\nHmm, interesting. So maybe there are non-AP sequences that have the same number of APs as the full AP. But can we have more?\n\nLet me check with n=5. Suppose the sequence is 1,2,3,4,5 (full AP). It has four APs: 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 1,3,5.\n\nIf I modify it to 1,2,3,5,6. Let's check triplets:\n\n1,2,3: AP.\n\n2,3,5: differences 1 and 2.\n\n2,3,6: differences 1 and 3.\n\n1,3,5: differences 2 and 2: AP.\n\n1,3,6: differences 2 and 3.\n\n1,2,5: differences 1 and 3.\n\n1,2,6: differences 1 and 4.\n\n1,5,6: differences 4 and 1.\n\n3,5,6: differences 2 and 1.\n\nSo APs: 1,2,3 and 1,3,5. So two APs. The original had four. So worse.\n\nAlternatively, what if I have 1,2,4,5,7. Let's check:\n\nPossible APs:\n\n1,2,4: no.\n\n1,2,5: no.\n\n1,2,7: no.\n\n1,4,5: no.\n\n1,4,7: yes, differences 3 and 3.\n\n1,5,7: no.\n\n2,4,5: no.\n\n2,4,7: no.\n\n2,5,7: yes, differences 3 and 2.\n\n4,5,7: no.\n\nSo APs: 1,4,7 and 2,5,8 (but 8 isn't there). Wait, 2,5,7: 5-2=3, 7-5=2. Not an AP. So only 1,4,7. So one AP. Worse than the full AP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1,3,5,7,9 (full AP). Then APs are 1,3,5; 3,5,7; 5,7,9; 1,5,9. So four APs. If I try to make another sequence with more, maybe 1,2,3,4,5. Wait, that's the same as the full AP. Let's see, the APs here are 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 1,3,5. So four APs. Same as the previous full AP.\n\nWait, but 1,3,5,7,9 has APs: consecutive triplets with difference 2, and then 1,5,9. So four APs as well.\n\nWait, maybe the number of APs depends on the common difference? No, in a full AP, regardless of the difference, the number of three-term APs is determined by the indices.\n\nSo perhaps for n=5, no matter how you arrange the sequence as an AP, you always get four APs, which seems to be the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we have a sequence that is not an AP but has more APs. For example, 1,2,3,4,6. Let's check:\n\n1,2,3: AP\n\n2,3,4: AP\n\n1,2,4: no\n\n1,3,4: no\n\n1,2,6: no\n\n1,3,6: no\n\n1,4,6: differences 3 and 2.\n\n2,3,6: no\n\n2,4,6: yes, differences 2 and 2.\n\n3,4,6: no\n\nSo APs: 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 2,4,6. So three APs. Still less than four.\n\nHmm. So seems like the full AP gives the maximum number. So maybe in general, the maximum number is achieved when the sequence is an AP, and the number is floor((n -1)^2 /4). Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{(n-1)^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor}.\n\nBut wait, let me check n=3. For n=3, any three-term monotone sequence is an AP, so there's 1 AP. According to the formula, floor((3 -1)^2 /4) = floor(4/4)=1. Correct.\n\nn=4: floor((4 -1)^2 /4)= floor(9/4)=2. Which matches.\n\nn=5: floor(16/4)=4. Correct.\n\nn=6: floor(25/4)=6.25\u21926. Let's check: for n=6, a full AP would have C(3,2)+C(3,2)=3+3=6. Yes, so 6 APs. So correct.\n\nBut let's verify with another example. Suppose n=6, sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6. The three-term APs are:\n\nConsecutive triplets: 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 4,5,6.\n\nNon-consecutive: 1,3,5; 2,4,6; 1,4,7 (7 not present); so only 1,3,5 and 2,4,6. Total of 6 APs. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula holds. Therefore, the maximum number of three-term arithmetic progressions is indeed floor[(n-1)^2 /4].\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"a monotone sequence of n distinct reals\". So even if the sequence is not equally spaced, but arranged in a way that maximizes the number of APs. But according to our examples, the maximum seems to be achieved by the equally spaced (i.e., arithmetic progression) sequence. Therefore, the maximum number is floor[(n-1)^2 /4], so the answer is \\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{(n-1)^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor}.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another structure. Suppose we have a sequence that consists of two overlapping arithmetic progressions. For example, 1,2,3,4,5,7. Wait, in this case, the APs would be:\n\n1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 1,3,5; 2,4,6 (6 not present); 4,5,7 (differences 1 and 2). So APs: four, same as n=6 would have 6 APs in a full AP. So this is worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arranging the sequence with multiple APs. For example, 1,2,3,5,6,7. The APs here:\n\n1,2,3; 5,6,7; 1,3,5 (diff 2); 2,5,8 (nope); 3,5,7 (diff 2); 1,5,9 (nope). So APs: 1,2,3; 5,6,7; 1,3,5; 3,5,7. So four APs. Still less than six.\n\nAlternatively, 1,2,4,5,7,8. Let's see:\n\n1,2,4: no.\n\n1,2,5: no.\n\n1,4,5: no.\n\n1,2,7: no.\n\n1,5,7: diff 4 and 2.\n\n2,4,5: no.\n\n2,5,7: diff 3 and 2.\n\n4,5,7: no.\n\nSimilarly on the higher end. Not many APs. So maybe two or three.\n\nSo in all these cases, deviating from the full AP structure reduces the number of APs. So that reinforces that the maximum is achieved by the full AP.\n\nAnother angle: suppose we try to model this as a graph problem. Each term is a vertex, and an edge connects two terms if their average is also present. Then the number of three-term APs is the number of edges in this graph. Wait, no. Actually, each three-term AP corresponds to a pair of terms whose average is present. So the number of three-term APs is equal to the number of such pairs. Therefore, maximizing the number of three-term APs is equivalent to maximizing the number of pairs (a, c) such that (a + c)/2 is also in the sequence.\n\nIn a sorted sequence, for two terms a and c, with a < c, the average (a + c)/2 must be a term in the sequence between a and c. So the problem reduces to choosing as many pairs (a, c) as possible such that their average is also in the sequence.\n\nIn the arithmetic progression, this is exactly the pairs where the indices have even sum. So as previously established.\n\nBut in a non-AP sequence, how many such pairs can we have? For each pair (a, c), if the average is present, that's one AP. To maximize the total number, we need as many such pairs as possible.\n\nHowever, in a general monotone sequence, the elements can be arranged in such a way that more averages fall into the sequence. But in reality, arranging the sequence as an AP maximizes the number of such pairs because every pair with an even distance has their average in the sequence, and there's no overlap or gaps. If you deviate from the AP, you might create some averages that are present, but you lose others.\n\nFor example, inserting a number that is not in the AP would disrupt the existing averages. So maybe you can't have more averages than in the AP case.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in the AP, the number of such pairs is maximized because of the regular spacing. Any deviation would cause some averages not to be in the sequence, thus reducing the count.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number is indeed achieved by the arithmetic progression, giving floor[(n-1)^2 /4] three-term APs.\n\nHence, the answer should be \\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{(n-1)^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum possible number of three-term arithmetic progressions is \\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{(n-1)^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor}.</think>To find the maximum number of three-term arithmetic progressions (APs) in a monotone sequence of \\( n \\) distinct real numbers, we start by considering the structure of such sequences.

        "Rationale": "Let \\( O \\) be the centre of the top face of the cylinder and let \\( r \\) be the radius of the cylinder. We need to determine the value of \\( QT^2 \\). Since \\( RS \\) is directly above \\( PQ \\), then \\( RP \\) is perpendicular to \\( PQ \\). This means that \\( \\triangle TPQ \\) is right-angled at \\( P \\). Since \\( PQ \\) is a diameter, then \\( PQ = 2r \\). By the Pythagorean Theorem, \\( QT^2 = PT^2 + PQ^2 = n^2 + (2r)^2 = n^2 + 4r^2 \\). So we need to determine the values of \\( n \\) and \\( r \\). We will use the information about \\( QU \\) and \\( UT \\) to determine these values. Join \\( U \\) to \\( O \\). Since \\( U \\) is halfway between \\( R \\) and \\( S \\), then the arcs \\( RU \\) and \\( US \\) are each one-quarter of the circle that bounds the top face of the cylinder. This means that \\( \\angle UOR = \\angle UOS = 90^{\\circ} \\). We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in \\( \\triangle UOR \\) and \\( \\triangle UOS \\), which are both right-angled at \\( O \\), to obtain \\( UR^2 = UO^2 + OR^2 = r^2 + r^2 = 2r^2 \\) and \\( US^2 = 2r^2 \\). Since \\( RP \\) and \\( QS \\) are both perpendicular to the top face of the cylinder, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in \\( \\triangle TRU \\) and in \\( \\triangle QSU \\) to obtain \\( QU^2 = QS^2 + US^2 = m^2 + 2r^2 \\) and \\( UT^2 = TR^2 + UR^2 = (PR - PT)^2 + 2r^2 = (QS - n)^2 + 2r^2 = (m - n)^2 + 2r^2 \\). Since \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\), then \\( QU^2 = 9^2 \\cdot 33 = 2673 \\). Since \\( UT = 40 \\), then \\( UT^2 = 1600 \\). Therefore, \\( m^2 + 2r^2 = 2673 \\) and \\( (m - n)^2 + 2r^2 = 1600 \\). Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain the equivalent equations \\( m^2 - (m - n)^2 = 1073 \\) and \\( m^2 - (m^2 - 2mn + n^2) = 1073 \\) and \\( 2mn - n^2 = 29 \\cdot 37 \\) and \\( n(2m - n) = 29 \\cdot 37 \\). Since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers, then \\( 2m - n \\) is an integer. Thus, \\( n \\) and \\( 2m - n \\) are a factor pair of \\( 29 \\cdot 37 = 1073 \\). Since 29 and 37 are prime numbers, the integer 1073 has only four positive divisors: 1, 29, 37, 1073. This gives the following possibilities: \\( n = 1, 2m - n = 1073, m = 537 \\); \\( n = 29, 2m - n = 37, m = 33 \\); \\( n = 37, 2m - n = 29, m = 33 \\); \\( n = 1073, 2m - n = 1, m = 537 \\). Since \\( m > n \\), then \\( n \\) cannot be 37 or 1073. Since \\( QU > QS \\), then \\( m < 9 \\sqrt{33} \\approx 51.7 \\). This means that \\( n = 29 \\) and \\( m = 33 \\). Since \\( (m - n)^2 + 2r^2 = 1600 \\), we obtain \\( 2r^2 = 1600 - (m - n)^2 = 1600 - 4^2 = 1584 \\) and so \\( QT^2 = n^2 + 4r^2 = 29^2 + 2(2r^2) = 841 + 3168 = 4009 \\).

        "Response": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100, given that \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\) and \\( UT = 40 \\). Hmm, let's start by visualizing the problem. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the relationship between the points Q, U, and T. The problem mentions \\( QU \\), \\( UT \\), and \\( QT \\). Since they are all labeled with two-letter combinations, these are likely points on a line or vertices of a triangle. But wait, the notation \\( QT^2 \\) suggests that QT is a length that is being squared, so maybe we are dealing with a right triangle or some geometric figure where the Pythagorean theorem might apply. \n\nGiven that \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\) and \\( UT = 40 \\), perhaps Q, U, and T form a right triangle? If that's the case, then QT would be the hypotenuse, and we could use the Pythagorean theorem to find QT. Then, once we have QT, we square it and find the remainder when divided by 100. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAssuming points Q, U, and T form a right triangle with right angle at U, then by Pythagoras, \\( QT^2 = QU^2 + UT^2 \\). Let's compute that. \n\nFirst, \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\), so \\( QU^2 = (9)^2 \\times (\\sqrt{33})^2 = 81 \\times 33 \\). Let me calculate that. 81 times 30 is 2430, and 81 times 3 is 243, so total is 2430 + 243 = 2673. \n\nNext, \\( UT = 40 \\), so \\( UT^2 = 40^2 = 1600 \\).\n\nAdding those together: 2673 + 1600 = 4273. Therefore, \\( QT^2 = 4273 \\). Then, the problem says \"the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\)\" so 4273 divided by 100. To find the remainder, we can look at the last two digits. 4273 divided by 100 is 42 with a remainder of 73. So the remainder is 73. \n\nWait, but hold on. The problem didn't specify that the triangle is a right triangle. Maybe I assumed that, but it wasn't stated. Hmm, that could be a problem. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem states: \"What is the remainder when the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100, given that \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\) and \\( UT = 40 \\).\" There is no mention of a right angle or a triangle. So perhaps Q, U, and T are collinear? If that's the case, then QT would be QU + UT, but then QT would be \\( 9 \\sqrt{33} + 40 \\), which isn't an integer. But the problem refers to \"the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\)\", so QT must be an integer length, or maybe QT squared is an integer. Wait, but if QT is a length, then QT squared would be a real number, but they specify \"the integer equal to QT^2\", so maybe QT^2 is an integer. \n\nBut if they are collinear, then QT = QU + UT, which is \\( 9 \\sqrt{33} + 40 \\), but squaring that would not be an integer. Similarly, if U is between Q and T, but if they are not collinear, then QT would be part of a triangle. But since we only have two sides given, maybe we need to assume a right triangle? But the problem doesn't state that. \n\nIs there another way? Maybe the Law of Cosines? If we can find the angle at U, then we could compute QT. But without knowing the angle, we can't apply the Law of Cosines directly. \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give any angles, so perhaps the assumption is that it's a right triangle? Maybe in the original problem context, like if this is from a diagram where the right angle is implied. Since the problem is presented without a diagram, but in many math problems, if two sides are given and you need to find the third without specifying the angle, they often expect a right triangle. Maybe the problem is from a coordinate geometry context where the distance formula is used, which is essentially the Pythagorean theorem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Q, U, T are points in a coordinate plane, and QU and UT are vectors or something else. But since the problem just gives lengths, I think the most straightforward approach is to assume that Q, U, T form a right triangle with legs QU and UT, and hypotenuse QT. Then, as above, QT^2 would be 4273, and the remainder when divided by 100 is 73. \n\nBut since the problem mentions \"the integer equal to QT^2\", and if QT^2 is 4273, which is an integer, then dividing by 100 gives 42*100 + 73, so remainder 73. That seems straightforward, but I need to confirm if the assumption of the right angle is valid. \n\nAlternatively, if they are not a right triangle, then QT could be longer or shorter. But since the problem is asking for QT^2 as an integer, and given the lengths of QU and UT, the only way QT^2 is an integer is if the triangle is right-angled. Because if it's not a right triangle, QT^2 would involve a cosine term which could be irrational. \n\nWait, for example, if angle at U is \u03b8, then by the Law of Cosines:\n\n\\( QT^2 = QU^2 + UT^2 - 2 \\cdot QU \\cdot UT \\cdot \\cos\u03b8 \\)\n\nBut unless \u03b8 is 90 degrees, the cosine term would be non-zero. If \u03b8 is 90 degrees, then cosine term is zero, and we get the Pythagorean theorem. But since the problem doesn't specify \u03b8, unless it's implied, we can't know for sure. However, since the problem refers to \"the integer equal to QT^2\", that suggests that QT^2 is an integer. If we don't assume a right angle, then QT^2 could be non-integer. \n\nGiven that QU is \\( 9 \\sqrt{33} \\), which is irrational, and UT is 40. Let's compute QU^2 + UT^2: 81*33 + 1600. As above, 81*33 is 2673, plus 1600 is 4273, which is an integer. If we have a right triangle, then QT^2 is 4273. If we don't have a right triangle, then QT^2 would be 4273 minus 2*QU*UT*cos\u03b8. But since QU is irrational (9 sqrt33) and UT is 40, then 2*QU*UT is 2*9 sqrt33*40 = 720 sqrt33. So unless cos\u03b8 is zero, we would have QT^2 being 4273 minus 720 sqrt33 * cos\u03b8. But sqrt33 is irrational, and unless cos\u03b8 is a multiple of sqrt33, which is impossible because cos\u03b8 is between -1 and 1, then QT^2 would be irrational. But the problem states \"the integer equal to QT^2\", so it must be that the term involving sqrt33 cancels out. The only way that can happen is if cos\u03b8 is zero, making that entire term zero. Hence, angle \u03b8 is 90 degrees. Therefore, the triangle must be right-angled at U. \n\nTherefore, my initial assumption was correct, and QT^2 is indeed 4273. Therefore, 4273 divided by 100 is 42 with a remainder of 73. So the remainder is 73. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's another interpretation. Suppose Q, U, T are collinear. Then QT would be QU + UT or |QU - UT|. Let's see:\n\nIf they are collinear, then QT is either QU + UT or |QU - UT|. Let's compute both:\n\nQU + UT = 9 sqrt33 + 40 \u2248 9*5.7446 + 40 \u2248 51.7014 + 40 \u2248 91.7014\n\n|QU - UT| = |9 sqrt33 - 40| \u2248 |51.7014 - 40| \u2248 11.7014\n\nThen QT^2 would be either (approx) 91.7014^2 \u2248 8410 or 11.7014^2 \u2248 137. Neither of these are integers. However, 8410 is close to 841, which is 29^2, but no, 91.7014 squared is approximately 8410. So neither of these would be integers. The problem says \"the integer equal to QT^2\", so that suggests that QT^2 must be an exact integer, not an approximate one. Therefore, the collinear case is invalid because QT^2 would not be an integer. Therefore, the only way for QT^2 to be an integer is if the triangle is right-angled at U, allowing QT^2 to be QU^2 + UT^2 = 4273, which is an integer. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when divided by 100 is 73. \n\nBut just to check once more, let's compute 4273 divided by 100. 100 goes into 4273 forty-two times, which is 4200, and 4273 - 4200 = 73. So yes, the remainder is 73. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 73.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder is \\boxed{73}.</think>Given \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\) and \\( UT = 40 \\), we need to find the remainder when the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100.\n\nFirst, we assume that points \\( Q \\), \\( U \\), and \\( T \\) form a right triangle with a right angle at \\( U \\).

        "Response": "Okay, so I need to figure out if there's an integer m such that m\u00b3 = 3n\u00b2 + 3n + 7, where n is also an integer. Hmm, interesting. Let me start by understanding the problem better. We have a cubic equation in m, but it's also related to a quadratic in n. So essentially, we need to find integers m and n that satisfy this equation. \n\nFirst, maybe I can rearrange the equation to see if there's a way to express n in terms of m or vice versa. Let's write it out:\n\nm\u00b3 = 3n\u00b2 + 3n + 7\n\nHmm, perhaps I can complete the square on the right-hand side for the n terms. Let's try that. The quadratic in n is 3n\u00b2 + 3n. Let me factor out the 3 first:\n\n3(n\u00b2 + n) + 7\n\nNow, to complete the square inside the parentheses, n\u00b2 + n. The coefficient of n is 1, so half of that is 1/2, square it is 1/4. So:\n\nn\u00b2 + n + 1/4 - 1/4 = (n + 1/2)\u00b2 - 1/4\n\nTherefore, substituting back in:\n\n3[(n + 1/2)\u00b2 - 1/4] + 7 = 3(n + 1/2)\u00b2 - 3/4 + 7 = 3(n + 1/2)\u00b2 + 25/4\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nm\u00b3 = 3(n + 1/2)\u00b2 + 25/4\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe working with fractions complicates things. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe I can consider modulo arithmetic to find possible contradictions or narrow down possible values.\n\nLet's try modulo 3. If we take both sides modulo 3, the equation becomes:\n\nm\u00b3 \u2261 3n\u00b2 + 3n + 7 mod 3\n\nSimplify the right-hand side: 3n\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod 3, 3n \u2261 0 mod 3, and 7 \u2261 1 mod 3. So:\n\nm\u00b3 \u2261 0 + 0 + 1 \u2261 1 mod 3\n\nSo m\u00b3 \u2261 1 mod 3. What are the cubes modulo 3? Let's compute:\n\n0\u00b3 \u2261 0 mod 3\n\n1\u00b3 \u2261 1 mod 3\n\n2\u00b3 = 8 \u2261 2 mod 3\n\nSo cubes modulo 3 can be 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, for m\u00b3 \u2261 1 mod 3, m must be \u2261 1 mod 3. So m = 3k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nTherefore, m is of the form 3k + 1. Let's substitute back into the original equation:\n\n(3k + 1)\u00b3 = 3n\u00b2 + 3n + 7\n\nExpanding the left-hand side:\n\n= 27k\u00b3 + 27k\u00b2 + 9k + 1\n\nTherefore:\n\n27k\u00b3 + 27k\u00b2 + 9k + 1 = 3n\u00b2 + 3n + 7\n\nSubtracting 7 from both sides:\n\n27k\u00b3 + 27k\u00b2 + 9k - 6 = 3n\u00b2 + 3n\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n9k\u00b3 + 9k\u00b2 + 3k - 2 = n\u00b2 + n\n\nHmm, so we have n\u00b2 + n = 9k\u00b3 + 9k\u00b2 + 3k - 2\n\nLet me rewrite the left side as n\u00b2 + n + 1/4 = (n + 1/2)\u00b2, but again fractions might complicate. Alternatively, maybe factor the left side:\n\nn(n + 1) = 9k\u00b3 + 9k\u00b2 + 3k - 2\n\nSince n and n + 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So their product is equal to this expression on the right. Not sure if that helps. Maybe try small integer values for k and see if we can find integer solutions n.\n\nAlternatively, let's analyze possible values of m. Since m\u00b3 = 3n\u00b2 + 3n +7, and 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 is positive for all integer n (since 3n\u00b2 +3n +7, discriminant of 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 is 9 - 84 = -75 <0, so the quadratic is always positive). Therefore m must be a positive integer. Wait, not necessarily, n can be negative. Wait, but m\u00b3 has to equal a positive number, so m must be positive. Because even if n is negative, 3n\u00b2 is positive, 3n could be negative, but let's check:\n\nSuppose n is negative. Let n = -t where t is a positive integer. Then:\n\n3n\u00b2 + 3n +7 = 3t\u00b2 -3t +7. For t \u22651, 3t\u00b2 -3t +7. When t=1: 3 -3 +7=7; t=2: 12 -6 +7=13; t=3:27 -9 +7=25, etc. So still positive. Therefore, m must be a positive integer.\n\nSo m is a positive integer, and n can be any integer (positive or negative). Let's see. Maybe try small values of n and see if 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 is a cube.\n\nLet's start with n = 0: 3(0) +0 +7=7. 7 is not a cube. n=1: 3 +3 +7=13, not a cube. n=2: 12 +6 +7=25, not a cube. n=3: 27 +9 +7=43, not a cube. n=4: 48 +12 +7=67, not a cube. n=5: 75 +15 +7=97, not a cube. n=6: 108 +18 +7=133, not a cube. n=7: 147 +21 +7=175, not a cube. n=8: 192 +24 +7=223, not a cube. n=9: 243 +27 +7=277, not a cube. Hmm, getting bigger, no cubes yet.\n\nWhat about negative n? Let's try n=-1: 3(-1)^2 +3(-1)+7=3 -3 +7=7, same as n=0. n=-2: 3(4) +3(-2) +7=12 -6 +7=13, same as n=1. n=-3: 27 -9 +7=25, same as n=2. So the values are symmetric around n=-0.5. So n and -(n+1) give the same value. For example, n=0 and n=-1 both give 7, n=1 and n=-2 both give13, etc. So we only need to check n \u22650.\n\nSo from n=0 upwards, the values are 7,13,25,43,67,97,133,175,223,277,... none of these seem to be cubes. The cubes are 1,8,27,64,125,216,343,... So 7 is between 1 and 8, 13 between 8 and 27, 25 is 5\u00b2 but not a cube, 43 between 27 and 64, 67 between 64 and 125, 97 same, 133 between 125 and 216, 175 same, 223 between 216 and 343, 277 same, etc. So in the range we've checked, up to n=9, the value is 277, which is less than 343=7\u00b3. So maybe the cube is larger. Let's check higher n.\n\nn=10: 3(100) +30 +7=300 +30 +7=337, which is less than 343=7\u00b3. n=11: 3(121)+33 +7=363 +33 +7=403, which is between 343 and 512=8\u00b3. n=12: 3(144)+36 +7=432 +36 +7=475, still less than 512. n=13: 3(169)+39 +7=507 +39 +7=553. n=14: 3(196)+42 +7=588 +42 +7=637. n=15:3(225)+45 +7=675 +45 +7=727. n=16:3(256)+48 +7=768 +48 +7=823. n=17:3(289)+51 +7=867 +51 +7=925. n=18:3(324)+54 +7=972 +54 +7=1033. Hmm, 1033 is between 1000=10\u00b3 and 1331=11\u00b3. n=19: 3(361)+57 +7=1083 +57 +7=1147. n=20: 3(400)+60 +7=1200 +60 +7=1267. 1267 is still less than 1331=11\u00b3. n=21:3(441)+63 +7=1323 +63 +7=1393. Now, 1393 is greater than 1331. So between n=21 and n=20, it crosses 11\u00b3=1331. Let's check if 1331 is achieved. For n=21, value is1393, which is 62 more than 1331. So no. How about n=18: 1033, n=19:1147, n=20:1267, n=21:1393. So 1331 is between n=20 and n=21, but there's no integer n where 3n\u00b2 +3n +7=1331. Let's verify:\n\nSuppose 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 =1331. Then 3n\u00b2 +3n=1324. Divide by 3: n\u00b2 +n = 1324/3 \u2248441.333. Not an integer. So no solution here. Similarly, check for 12\u00b3=1728. Let's see when 3n\u00b2 +3n +7=1728. 3n\u00b2 +3n=1721. Divide by3: n\u00b2 +n=573.666, not integer. So seems like no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try m=7: 7\u00b3=343. So check if 3n\u00b2 +3n +7=343. Then 3n\u00b2 +3n=336. Divide by3: n\u00b2 +n=112. So n\u00b2 +n -112=0. Discriminant:1 +448=449. sqrt(449)\u224821.2. Not integer. So no solution. Similarly, m=8:512. 3n\u00b2 +3n +7=512. 3n\u00b2 +3n=505. Divide by3: n\u00b2 +n=168.333. Not integer. m=9:729. 3n\u00b2 +3n=729 -7=722. 722/3\u2248240.666. Not integer. m=10:1000. 3n\u00b2 +3n=1000 -7=993. 993/3=331. So n\u00b2 +n=331. n\u00b2 +n -331=0. Discriminant:1 +1324=1325. sqrt(1325)=~36.4. Not integer. m=11:1331. 3n\u00b2 +3n=1331 -7=1324. 1324/3\u2248441.333. Not integer. m=12:1728. 3n\u00b2 +3n=1728 -7=1721. 1721/3\u2248573.666. Not integer. m=13:2197. 3n\u00b2 +3n=2197 -7=2190. 2190/3=730. So n\u00b2 +n=730. n\u00b2 +n -730=0. Discriminant:1 +2920=2921. sqrt(2921)\u224854.05. Not integer. Hmm.\n\nSo so far, up to m=13, none of them yield integer n. Maybe this suggests there's no solution. But how do I prove it in general?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the equation modulo 9. Let's take the original equation:\n\nm\u00b3 = 3n\u00b2 + 3n +7\n\nCompute both sides modulo 9.\n\nFirst, possible cubes modulo9:\n\n0\u00b3=0\n\n1\u00b3=1\n\n2\u00b3=8\n\n3\u00b3=0\n\n4\u00b3=64\u22611\n\n5\u00b3=125\u22618\n\n6\u00b3=216\u22610\n\n7\u00b3=343\u22611\n\n8\u00b3=512\u22618\n\nSo cubes modulo9 are 0,1,8.\n\nNow, compute right-hand side modulo9: 3n\u00b2 +3n +7.\n\nLet\u2019s see possible values of 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 mod9. Let's consider n mod3, since coefficients are multiples of3. Wait, but maybe n modulo3 might not be sufficient. Let me check n modulo9 for thoroughness.\n\nBut maybe compute 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 mod9. Let\u2019s compute for n=0 to8:\n\nn=0: 0 +0 +7=7\u22617 mod9\n\nn=1:3 +3 +7=13\u22614 mod9\n\nn=2:12 +6 +7=25\u22617 mod9\n\nn=3:27 +9 +7=43\u22617 mod9\n\nWait, wait, n=3:3*(9) +3*3 +7=27 +9 +7=43\u226143-9*4=43-36=7 mod9\n\nn=4:3*(16) +12 +7=48 +12 +7=67\u226167-9*7=67-63=4 mod9\n\nn=5:3*25 +15 +7=75 +15 +7=97\u226197-9*10=97-90=7 mod9\n\nn=6:3*36 +18 +7=108 +18 +7=133\u2261133-9*14=133-126=7 mod9\n\nn=7:3*49 +21 +7=147 +21 +7=175\u2261175-9*19=175-171=4 mod9\n\nn=8:3*64 +24 +7=192 +24 +7=223\u2261223-9*24=223-216=7 mod9\n\nSo the residues mod9 for the right-hand side 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 are either 4 or7 mod9, depending on n.\n\nFrom the computations above, when n\u22610,2,3,5,6,8 mod9: 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 \u22617 mod9\n\nWhen n\u22611,4,7 mod9: 3n\u00b2 +3n +7\u22614 mod9\n\nBut the left-hand side m\u00b3 mod9 is either0,1,8. So we have:\n\nIf m\u00b3 \u22610,1,8 mod9, but the right-hand side is either4 or7 mod9. Therefore, 4 and7 are not among the possible residues for m\u00b3 mod9. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, the equation has no solutions.\n\nWait, hold on. So if 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 is congruent to 4 or7 mod9, but m\u00b3 can only be 0,1,8 mod9. Therefore, 3n\u00b2 +3n +7 can never be a cube, since it's \u22614 or7 mod9, which are not cubes modulo9. Therefore, there are no integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, such integer does not exist.\n\nBut wait, let me check my modulo9 analysis again to be sure. So m\u00b3 mod9 can be 0,1,8. The right-hand side is either4 or7 mod9. Since 4 and7 are not in {0,1,8}, there's a contradiction. Therefore, no solutions. So yes, the equation has no integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{No}\n\n\\\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{No}</think>To determine if there exists an integer \\( m \\) such that its cube is equal to \\( 3n^2 + 3n + 7 \\) for some integer \\( n \\), we start by analyzing the equation modulo 9.\n\nFirst, we note that the possible residues of a cube modulo 9 are 0, 1, and 8.

        "Response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the range of this function f(A). The function is given as a big fraction with sine A in the numerator and tangent A times (sec A minus sine A times tangent A) in the denominator. The domain is all real numbers except multiples of \u03c0/2, which makes sense because tangent and secant are undefined there. \n\nFirst, maybe I should simplify both the numerator and the denominator step by step. Let's start with the numerator. The numerator is sin A multiplied by this expression inside the parentheses: 3 cos\u00b2A + cos\u2074A + 3 sin\u00b2A + (sin\u00b2A)(cos\u00b2A). Let me write that out more clearly:\n\nNumerator = sin A [3 cos\u00b2A + cos\u2074A + 3 sin\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A cos\u00b2A]\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor or combine terms here. Let's look at the terms inside the brackets:\n\nFirst, group the terms with cos^4 and sin^2 cos^2. That is cos^4A + sin\u00b2A cos\u00b2A. Then the remaining terms are 3 cos\u00b2A + 3 sin\u00b2A. \n\nSo, grouping:\n\ncos^4A + sin\u00b2A cos\u00b2A + 3 cos\u00b2A + 3 sin\u00b2A\n\nFactor out cos\u00b2A from the first two terms:\n\ncos\u00b2A (cos\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A) + 3 (cos\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A)\n\nBut cos\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A is 1, so this simplifies to:\n\ncos\u00b2A (1) + 3 (1) = cos\u00b2A + 3\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to sin A (cos\u00b2A + 3). That's much simpler!\n\nSo numerator simplifies to sin A (cos\u00b2A + 3). Good.\n\nNow let's look at the denominator. The denominator is tan A times (sec A - sin A tan A). Let me write that out:\n\nDenominator = tan A [sec A - sin A tan A]\n\nLet me recall that tan A = sin A / cos A, sec A = 1 / cos A. Let's substitute those in.\n\nDenominator = (sin A / cos A) [1 / cos A - sin A (sin A / cos A)]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: 1 / cos A\n\nSecond term: sin\u00b2A / cos A\n\nSo inside the brackets: (1 / cos A) - (sin\u00b2A / cos A) = (1 - sin\u00b2A) / cos A\n\nBut 1 - sin\u00b2A is cos\u00b2A, so this becomes cos\u00b2A / cos A = cos A\n\nTherefore, the denominator simplifies to (sin A / cos A) * cos A = sin A\n\nWait, let me check that step again. The denominator was tan A [sec A - sin A tan A]. We substituted tan A as sin A / cos A and sec A as 1 / cos A. Then inside the brackets, we had 1 / cos A - sin\u00b2A / cos A, which is (1 - sin\u00b2A)/cos A = cos\u00b2A / cos A = cos A. Then multiply that by tan A (which is sin A / cos A):\n\nSo denominator becomes (sin A / cos A) * cos A = sin A. Oh! So the denominator simplifies to sin A.\n\nTherefore, the entire function f(A) is numerator / denominator = [sin A (cos\u00b2A + 3)] / sin A. The sin A cancels out, assuming sin A \u2260 0. But wait, the original function is defined when A \u2260 n\u03c0/2. So when sin A = 0, which is at A = n\u03c0, but those points are excluded because n\u03c0/2 includes n\u03c0 (when n is even). So yes, sin A can be zero only at A = n\u03c0, which are excluded. So we can safely cancel sin A.\n\nTherefore, f(A) simplifies to cos\u00b2A + 3. Wait, that's it? So f(A) = cos\u00b2A + 3. Then the range of f(A) is the range of cos\u00b2A + 3.\n\nBut cos\u00b2A ranges between 0 and 1, so cos\u00b2A + 3 ranges from 3 to 4. Therefore, the range is [3, 4]. But we need to make sure there are no restrictions due to the original function's domain.\n\nWait, but in the original function, A \u2260 n\u03c0/2. However, even at points where A approaches n\u03c0/2, cos\u00b2A still approaches either 0 or 1 (if A approaches (2k+1)\u03c0/2, cos A approaches 0, so cos\u00b2A approaches 0; if A approaches k\u03c0, cos\u00b2A approaches 1). But since those points are excluded, the function f(A) = cos\u00b2A + 3 can take all values between 0 + 3 = 3 and 1 + 3 = 4, excluding the points where A is not allowed. However, since cos\u00b2A is continuous everywhere except at points where cos A is undefined, which are already excluded (A \u2260 n\u03c0/2). But cos\u00b2A is actually defined everywhere, but the original function f(A) has exclusions where tan A or sec A are undefined. However, after simplification, f(A) = cos\u00b2A + 3, which is defined for all real numbers except where the original denominator was zero or undefined.\n\nWait a second, let's double-check. When we canceled sin A in numerator and denominator, we assumed sin A \u2260 0, which is okay because sin A = 0 occurs at A = n\u03c0, which are excluded (since n\u03c0 = 2*(n/2)\u03c0, so when n is even, A = n\u03c0/2 would be excluded). Wait, actually the original domain is A \u2260 n\u03c0/2. So A = n\u03c0/2 includes A = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2, etc. So points where A is a multiple of \u03c0/2. Therefore, A = n\u03c0 (which are 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc.) are included in the exclusion. So sin A is zero at those points, which are excluded. So when simplifying f(A) = cos\u00b2A + 3, the expression cos\u00b2A + 3 is defined for all real numbers, but the original function f(A) is only defined for A \u2260 n\u03c0/2. However, even though cos\u00b2A + 3 is defined everywhere, the original function can't take values at A = n\u03c0/2. But in terms of range, since cos\u00b2A + 3 is continuous and can take all values between 3 and 4 as A approaches any real number except n\u03c0/2. However, even at points near n\u03c0/2, the function can approach the same limits. For example, as A approaches \u03c0/2, cos\u00b2A approaches 0, so f(A) approaches 3. Similarly, as A approaches 0 or \u03c0, cos\u00b2A approaches 1, so f(A) approaches 4. Since the function is continuous on its domain, which is R except discrete points, the range should still be all real numbers between 3 and 4. Because between any two excluded points, the function is continuous and can take all values in between.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose A approaches \u03c0/2 from the left. Then cos A approaches 0, so cos\u00b2A approaches 0, so f(A) approaches 3. Similarly, approaching \u03c0/2 from the right, same thing. But near A = 0, cos\u00b2A approaches 1, so f(A) approaches 4. So even though A = 0 is excluded, the function can get arbitrarily close to 4. Similarly, near A = \u03c0/2, the function gets close to 3. Since the function is continuous on its domain (which is R minus the discrete points n\u03c0/2), then between any two consecutive excluded points, the function is continuous, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it takes all values between 3 and 4. Therefore, the range is [3, 4].\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with specific examples. For instance, when A = \u03c0/4, which is allowed. Then cos\u00b2(\u03c0/4) = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 1/2. So f(A) = 1/2 + 3 = 3.5. Similarly, when A = \u03c0/3, cos\u00b2(\u03c0/3) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, so f(A) = 1/4 + 3 = 3.25. Wait, no, wait cos(\u03c0/3) is 0.5, so cos\u00b2(\u03c0/3) is 0.25. Wait, but 0.25 + 3 = 3.25. Wait, but that's between 3 and 4. Wait, but if A approaches 0, cos\u00b2A approaches 1, so f(A) approaches 4. If A approaches \u03c0/2, cos\u00b2A approaches 0, so f(A) approaches 3. Therefore, the function f(A) can take all values between 3 and 4. So the range is [3,4].\n\nBut let me check another angle. Let's take A approaching \u03c0/4. Wait, but regardless of the angle, cos\u00b2A is always between 0 and 1, so f(A) is between 3 and 4. So the range is [3,4]. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{[3,4]}.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no mistakes in simplification. Let's go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal numerator:\n\nsin A [3 cos\u00b2A + cos^4A + 3 sin\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A cos\u00b2A]\n\nGroup terms:\n\n= sin A [cos^4A + sin\u00b2A cos\u00b2A + 3 cos\u00b2A + 3 sin\u00b2A]\n\nFactor:\n\n= sin A [cos\u00b2A (cos\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A) + 3 (cos\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A)]\n\nSince cos\u00b2A + sin\u00b2A = 1:\n\n= sin A [cos\u00b2A * 1 + 3 * 1]\n\n= sin A (cos\u00b2A + 3). Correct.\n\nDenominator:\n\ntan A [sec A - sin A tan A]\n\nExpress in terms of sin and cos:\n\n= (sin A / cos A) [1 / cos A - sin A (sin A / cos A)]\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n= (sin A / cos A) [ (1 - sin\u00b2A) / cos A ]\n\n= (sin A / cos A) [ cos\u00b2A / cos A ]\n\n= (sin A / cos A) (cos A )\n\n= sin A. Correct.\n\nThus, f(A) = [sin A (cos\u00b2A + 3)] / sin A = cos\u00b2A + 3, with sin A \u2260 0. But since A \u2260 n\u03c0/2, sin A is only zero when A is n\u03c0, which is excluded. However, when sin A \u2260 0, we can cancel it, so f(A) = cos\u00b2A + 3. Since cos\u00b2A can take any value between 0 and 1 (excluding points where A = n\u03c0/2, but as discussed, the function can still approach those limits), the range is indeed [3,4].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{[3, 4]}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{[3, 4]}</think>To find the range of the function \\( f(A) \\), we start by simplifying both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe numerator is given by:\n\\[\n\\sin A \\left( 3 \\cos^2 A + \\cos^4 A + 3 \\sin^2 A + \\sin^2 A \\cos^2 A \\right)\n\\]\n\nGrouping and factoring the terms inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n\\cos^4 A + \\sin^2 A \\cos^2 A + 3 \\cos^2 A + 3 \\sin^2 A\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\cos^2 A (\\cos^2 A + \\sin^2 A) + 3 (\\cos^2 A + \\sin^2 A)\n\\]\nSince \\(\\cos^2 A + \\sin^2 A = 1\\):\n\\[\n= \\cos^2 A \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 1 = \\cos^2 A + 3\n\\]\n\nThus, the numerator simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\sin A (\\cos^2 A + 3)\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the denominator:\n\\[\n\\tan A (\\sec A - \\sin A \\tan A)\n\\]\n\nExpressing \\(\\tan A\\) and \\(\\sec A\\) in terms of \\(\\sin A\\) and \\(\\cos A\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos A} - \\sin A \\cdot \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sin^2 A}{\\cos A} \\right)\n\\]\nSince \\(1 - \\sin^2 A = \\cos^2 A\\):\n\\[\n= \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} \\cdot \\frac{\\cos^2 A}{\\cos A} = \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} \\cdot \\cos A = \\sin A\n\\]\n\nThus, the denominator simplifies to \\(\\sin A\\).\n\nThe function \\( f(A) \\) then simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(A) = \\frac{\\sin A (\\cos^2 A + 3)}{\\sin A} = \\cos^2 A + 3\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\cos^2 A\\) ranges from 0 to 1 for all \\(A \\neq \\frac{n \\pi}{2}\\), the function \\(\\cos^2 A + 3\\) ranges from \\(0 + 3 = 3\\) to \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).
