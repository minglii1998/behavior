Hmm, intersecting the y-axis at exactly one point means that the circle is tangent to the y-axis, right? Because if it intersects at two points, it's passing through the y-axis, and if it doesn't intersect, it's either to the left or right without touching. But tangent would mean just touching at one point. So, how do I determine if a circle is tangent to the y-axis?",
