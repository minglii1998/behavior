From what I recall, when you have a sample statistic, like 32% here, the margin of error gives a range around that statistic where the true population parameter is likely to be. So if the margin of error is 3.41%, that would mean we can be 95% confident (assuming that's the confidence level they're using, which is standard unless stated otherwise) that the true percentage is between 32% minus 3.41% and 32% plus 3.41%. So that would be 28.59% to 35.41%. ",
