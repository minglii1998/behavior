        "text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about a study on fish weights in a pond. They took a random sample, made sure not to weigh any fish more than once. The sample had 150 largemouth bass, and 30% of those weighed more than 2 pounds. Then we have four choices for conclusions. I need to figure out which one is best supported by the data.",

So unless we know that largemouth bass are the only type of fish, or that other fish have similar weight distributions, we can't generalize to all fish. So A might be making too broad a claim.",
