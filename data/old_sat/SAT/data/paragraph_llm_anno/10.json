        "class-1-reason": "This paragraph summarizes the problem and mentions that the options will be considered one by one. It sets up a plan for evaluating the choices, which is goal-directed and methodical. There\u2019s no exploratory or verification language.",

        "text": "First, the percentages add up to 98%, which leaves 2% unaccounted for. Option A says the percentages don't add up to 100%, making conclusions invalid. But is that really a big issue? I think polls often have rounding errors or maybe some people didn't answer, so the total might not be exactly 100. So maybe A isn't the best answer. The problem isn't necessarily that the math is wrong, but more about how the data was collected.",
        "class-1-reason": "This paragraph evaluates Option A in a straightforward way: it checks if the total percentages being 98% is a serious problem, and reasons that it's likely due to rounding or missing answers. The language is confident and result-oriented, focused on systematically ruling out an answer rather than experimenting or checking a solution.",

        "text": "Then there's option B: the respondents weren't a random sample. That makes sense because the poll was on the show's website. So only viewers of that specific cable news show would know about it, and even among them, only those who stayed until the end and were motivated to go online and respond. This creates a self-selected sample, which is biased. Cable news audiences often have particular political leanings, depending on the network. So B seems like a strong candidate.",
        "class-1-reason": "In this paragraph, Option B is considered in a factual, step-by-step manner: the paragraph logically explains why the sample is biased and why this is a strong answer. There is no uncertainty or off-plan speculation, just systematic evaluation.",

        "text": "Option C says there weren't 50-50 responses. But why would that matter? The real population isn't necessarily split 50-50. The issue isn't about balance but whether the sample reflects the population. So C might be a distractor, assuming a balanced response is needed, which isn't the case. If the actual population was, say, 30-70, the poll could be accurate. So C probably isn't the answer.",

If they only allowed a short window, maybe only the most passionate viewers responded quickly. But without specific info on time constraints, this is speculative. However, even with enough time, the bigger issue is the self-selection bias. So D might be a possible issue, but B seems more fundamental.",
        "class-1-reason": "This paragraph discusses Option D but quickly dismisses it with logical explanation and prioritizes answer B.

This is a voluntary response sample, which is prone to bias because people with strong opinions (especially negative ones) are more likely to participate. Hence, the results don't represent the broader population. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.</think>The correct answer is **B) Those who responded to the poll were not a random sample of the population of the United States.** ",
        "class-1-reason": "This paragraph confidently explains the main reason the poll is unrepresentative, states the concept of voluntary response bias, and directly arrives at the correct answer.

This creates a **self-selected sample**, which is inherently biased. Such samples often overrepresent individuals with strong opinions (e.g., opposition to the policy) and underrepresent others. Additionally, cable news audiences may skew toward specific demographics or political leanings, further reducing the poll's generalizability. While the percentages not adding to 100% (A) or time constraints (D) could be minor issues, the lack of a random sample is the primary reason the results are unrepresentative. Option C is irrelevant, as there\u2019s no requirement for polls to show a 50-50 split.",
        "class-1-reason": "This paragraph elaborates on the explanation, listing the ways in which the poll\u2019s sample is biased and why other answer choices are less relevant.
