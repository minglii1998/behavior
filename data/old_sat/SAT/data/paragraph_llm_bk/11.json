The survey was conducted on a random sample of 200 residents, and all of them responded, with 87% saying they are satisfied with the concession stand. The statements to evaluate are I and II, and the options are A) Neither, B) I only, C) II only, D) I and II. ",

    "text": "First, let me recall some basic concepts about surveys and statistics. When a sample is taken from a population, the sample statistic (in this case, 87% satisfaction) is used to estimate the population parameter. However, it's important to remember that this is just an estimate. The actual percentage in the entire population might be different due to sampling variability. Also, if another sample is taken, the result might not be exactly the same as the first one. This relates to the idea of confidence intervals and margin of error.",

The key here is that the sample was 200 residents, which is a good size, but it's still a sample. Unless the sample is the entire population (which it isn't, because it's specified as a sample), we can't be certain that exactly 87% of all residents are satisfied. The 87% is an estimate, and while it might be close to the true population percentage, it's not necessarily exactly the same. So statement I is making a definitive claim about the entire population based on a sample. That seems like an overreach. Therefore, statement I might not necessarily be true.",

Even if the first sample had 87%, the next sample could vary. The proportion in a second sample is subject to sampling variability. For example, if the true population proportion is around 87%, we'd expect most samples to be close to that, but not exactly 87%. The variability depends on factors like sample size and population variance. So, it's not guaranteed that another sample would also have exactly 87% satisfaction. Therefore, statement II also might not be true.",

Unless the survey was a census (surveying the entire population), we can't be certain that the sample statistic equals the population parameter.
