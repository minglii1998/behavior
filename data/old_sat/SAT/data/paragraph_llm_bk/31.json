If T is the temperature, then subtracting (9/25)(100 - H) from T would give a lower value D. Let me see: If H is 100%, then (100 - H) would be 0, so D = T, which makes sense because when relative humidity is 100%, the dew point equals the temperature. If H is lower, then (100 - H) is positive, so D would be less than T. That makes sense. So maybe the original formula was meant to be D = T - (9/25)(100 - H).
