Wait, but is that correct? Let me confirm. If angle C is the right angle (90\u00b0), then angles A and B are the other two angles. Since angle B is given as 30\u00b0, angle A must indeed be 60\u00b0, because 30\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0, which fits the triangle angle sum. So angle A is 60\u00b0.",
