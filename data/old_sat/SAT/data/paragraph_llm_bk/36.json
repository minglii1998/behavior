First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The function is a quadratic in terms of x, and there's a constant t involved. The graph of this function goes through the specific point (24, 0), which means when x is 24, y is 0.

Let me compute that. 24 + 14 is 38, so 38 times (t - 24) equals 0. So, 38*(t - 24) = 0. Hmm, solving for t here. Since 38 isn't zero, the other factor must be zero. Therefore, t - 24 = 0, which implies t = 24. Oh, so t is 24? Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check that again. If I plug x = 24 into g(x), then (24 + 14)(t - 24) = 38*(t - 24).
