  {
    "text": "First, let's break down the costs. The activation fee is a one-time charge, which means no matter how many months you use the service, you only pay that $35 once. So that part of the cost isn't going to change based on the number of months. Then, there's a monthly cost of $23. That means every month, you have to pay $23, so if you have t months, you'd have to multiply 23 by t to get the total monthly cost over that period.",
