So x equals 25. But wait, the question is asking for the value of x + 4, not just x. So if x is 25, then x + 4 would be 25 + 4, which is 29. Hmm, so the answer should be C) 29?",

Which is 1*(x + 4) = 29, so x + 4 = 29. Oh, that's even simpler! So instead of expanding everything, I could have just subtracted 4(x + 4) from both sides first, leading directly to (x + 4) = 29.

Similarly, if x + 4 was 33, x would be 29. Then left side: 5*(29 + 4) = 5*33 = 165. Right side: 4*33 + 29 = 132 + 29 = 161. Not equal. If x + 4 was -4, x would be -8. Left side: 5*(-8 +4) = 5*(-4) = -20. Right side: 4*(-4) +29 = -16 +29=13. Not equal. So yes, only option C works. So the answer must be C) 29.",
