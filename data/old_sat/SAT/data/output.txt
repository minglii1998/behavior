Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the business owner needs to buy 81 chairs, and the total budget is $14,000, which already includes a 7% sales tax. The question is asking for the maximum possible price per chair before the sales tax. The answer choices are given, so I need to work through the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. The total amount of $14,000 includes sales tax. So, the actual price of the chairs without tax plus 7% of that price equals $14,000. Since the business owner is purchasing 81 chairs, we need to find the price per chair before tax, then multiply by 81, add 7% tax, and make sure it doesn't exceed $14,000. But since we need the maximum possible price per chair, we need to set up an equation where total cost including tax is equal to $14,000 and solve for the price per chair.

Let me write that down. Let’s denote the price per chair before tax as "x". Then, the total cost before tax would be 81x. Then, the sales tax on that amount would be 7% of 81x, which is 0.07 * 81x. So, the total cost including tax is 81x + 0.07*81x. Alternatively, since sales tax is added to the original price, we can also think of the total cost as 81x multiplied by 1.07 (which is 100% + 7%). 

So, 81x * 1.07 = 14,000. 

To find x, we can divide both sides by 81 and then by 1.07. So,

x = 14,000 / (81 * 1.07)

Let me calculate that. First, compute the denominator: 81 multiplied by 1.07. Let me do 81*1.07. 80*1.07 is 85.6, and 1*1.07 is 1.07, so total is 85.6 + 1.07 = 86.67. Wait, that seems right? Let me check again. 81 * 1.07:

81 * 1 = 81

81 * 0.07 = 5.67

Adding them together: 81 + 5.67 = 86.67. Yes, that's correct.

So the denominator is 86.67. Therefore, x = 14,000 / 86.67. Let me compute that. Hmm, 14,000 divided by 86.67. Let me see. Let's approximate.

First, note that 86.67 * 160 = ?

Well, 80*160=12,800

6.67*160=1,067.2

So total is 12,800 + 1,067.2 = 13,867.2

That's a bit below 14,000. Let's try 161.

86.67 * 161 = 86.67*(160 +1) = 86.67*160 + 86.67*1 = 13,867.2 + 86.67 = 13,953.87

Still less than 14,000. Next, 162:

86.67*162 = 13,953.87 + 86.67 = 14,040.54

Ah, that's over 14,000. So between 161 and 162. Let me see where exactly. So, 14,000 - 13,953.87 = 46.13

So, 46.13 / 86.67 ≈ 0.532. So approximately 161.53.

Therefore, x ≈ 161.53. So, looking at the options, choice B is 161.53, which matches exactly. But wait, the question says "closest to the maximum possible price per chair, before sales tax". But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with taxes, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the total amount paid includes tax, so we need to back out the tax. Let me verify the equation again. Let’s confirm:

Total cost including tax = total cost before tax + tax = total cost before tax * (1 + tax rate). So, yes, 81x * 1.07 = 14,000. Therefore, solving for x, x = 14,000 / (1.07*81) ≈ 14,000 / 86.67 ≈ 161.53.

That seems correct. So the answer should be B) 161.53. But let me check the answer choices again. The options are:

A) $148.15

B) $161.53

C) $172.84

D) $184.94

So, according to my calculation, B is the exact value. However, maybe there's a different way to approach the problem, like maybe considering dividing the total budget by the number of chairs first, then backing out the tax? Let me try that alternative method to verify.

If I take the total budget of $14,000 and divide by 81 chairs first, that would give me the price per chair including tax. Then, to find the price before tax, I would divide that amount by 1.07.

So, that would be: (14,000 / 81) / 1.07.

Let me compute that. First, 14,000 divided by 81. Let's see:

81*172 = 81*170 + 81*2 = 13,770 + 162 = 13,932

14,000 - 13,932 = 68

So 14,000 / 81 = 172 + 68/81 ≈ 172 + 0.8395 ≈ 172.8395, which is approximately 172.84. Then, divide that by 1.07 to get the price before tax.

172.84 / 1.07. Let's compute that. 1.07*161 = 161 + 161*0.07 = 161 + 11.27 = 172.27

1.07*161.5 = 172.27 + 1.07*0.5 = 172.27 + 0.535 = 172.805

1.07*161.53 ≈ 172.805 + 1.07*0.03 ≈ 172.805 + 0.0321 ≈ 172.8371

So, 1.07*161.53 ≈ 172.8371, which is very close to 172.84. Therefore, 172.84 /1.07 ≈161.53. Hence, same result.

Therefore, both methods give us approximately $161.53, which is option B. So, that's the answer. But let me check once more for any possible mistakes.

Wait, another way to think: if 81 chairs cost P each before tax, total before tax is 81P. Then, total tax is 0.07*81P = 5.67P. Total cost is 81P +5.67P =86.67P=14,000. So P=14,000/86.67≈161.53. So same result. Therefore, seems correct.

Therefore, the answer should be B.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}</think>The business owner needs to purchase 81 chairs with a total budget of $14,000, which includes a 7% sales tax. To find the maximum possible price per chair before tax, we set up the equation considering the total cost including tax.

Let \( x \) be the price per chair before tax. The total cost before tax is \( 81x \), and the sales tax is 7% of this amount, which is \( 0.07 \times 81x \). The total cost including tax is then \( 81x \times 1.07 \).

We solve for \( x \):
\[
81x \times 1.07 = 14,000
\]
\[
x = \frac{14,000}{81 \times 1.07}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
81 \times 1.07 = 86.67
\]

Then, divide the total budget by this result:
\[
x = \frac{14,000}{86.67} \approx 161.53
\]

Thus, the maximum possible price per chair before sales tax is closest to option B.

\[
\boxed{B}
