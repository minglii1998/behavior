    "text": "First, let me recall what an x-intercept is. The x-intercept of a graph is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-value is zero. So, in this context, the x-intercept would be the time (x) when the speed (y) becomes zero. That makes sense because when Sheila applies the brakes, her speed decreases over time until she comes to a complete stop.",

    "text": "A) The speed before braking \u2013 That's when x = 0, right? So if x is the time after applying brakes, then x=0 would be the initial speed, which is the y-intercept, not the x-intercept. So A is not correct.",

    "text": "B) The rate of decrease in speed per second \u2013 That's probably the slope of the line. If the equation is linear (since it's a line), the coefficient of x would represent the rate of deceleration. For example, if the equation is y = -5x + 20, then -5 is the slope, meaning the speed decreases by 5 feet per second each second. So B is talking about the slope, not the x-intercept.

But the x-intercept is just a time value. To get distance, you would need to integrate the speed over time or calculate the area under the curve.
