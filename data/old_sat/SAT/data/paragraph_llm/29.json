    "text": "Okay, so I need to find the probability of selecting a participant from group A, given that the participant is at least 10 years old. Hmm, let me remember how conditional probability works. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Right, so in this case, event A is selecting someone from group A, and event B is selecting someone who is at least 10 years old. So I need to find the probability that someone is in group A and at least 10 years old, divided by the probability that someone is at least 10 years old.",

    "text": "Looking at the table, let me first figure out how many participants are at least 10 years old. The age groups are 0-9, 10-19, and 20+. So the participants who are at least 10 years old would be in the 10-19 and 20+ columns. Let me check the totals for those columns. The total for 10-19 years is 30, and the total for 20+ years is also 30. So adding those together, there are 30 + 30 = 60 participants who are at least 10 years old. So P(B) is 60/90, which simplifies to 2/3.",

So as a decimal, 23 divided by 60 is approximately 0.3833..., but the question says to express as a decimal or fraction. Since 23 and 60 don't have common factors (23 is a prime number, and 60 is 2*2*3*5), the fraction 23/60 is already in simplest form. So I should present that as the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any numbers from the table. Let me check group B and C too, but no, the question is about group A. So yes, 23 in group A and at least 10, total 60 in that age range. Therefore, 23/60 is correct. Alright, that seems right.",
