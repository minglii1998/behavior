So, first, I remember that parallel lines have the same slope. Is that correct? Yeah, if two lines are parallel, they never intersect, which means their steepness has to be the same. So their slopes must be equal.",

    "class-1-reason": "The solver muses about verifying if the lines are parallel but concludes there's no need since the problem states it.

    "text": "Another way to approach this is to think about the definition of slope. Slope is rise over run, right? So if two lines are parallel, they have to rise and run at the same rate; otherwise, they would eventually intersect. So for every 1 unit you move to the right along line k, you go up 1/4 units. Since line j is parallel, moving the same 1 unit to the right should also result in a 1/4 unit increase in y. Hence, the slope is 1/4. ",
    "class-1-reason": "Here the solver considers an alternative method by connecting the geometric definition of slope to behavior of parallel lines, offering a deeper or different justification for their equality.

Since line j is parallel to line k, which is neither horizontal nor vertical, line j must also have the same slope as line k, which is 1/4. So, no tricks there.",

So another point is (4,2). The slope between these two points is (2 - 1)/(4 - 0) = 1/4. If line j is parallel, it must have the same slope.
