Let me get a better estimate. Let's see, 7.5 squared is 56.25, right? Because 7 times 7 is 49, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and the cross term is 2*7*0.5 = 7. So, 49 + 7 + 0.25 = 56.25.

That's really close to 58. So, 58 minus 57.76 is 0.24. So, the square of 7.6 is 57.76, which is 0.24 less than 58. So, how much more do we need to add to 7.6 to get to 58?",
