    "text": "First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. The average, or mean, is the total divided by the number of students. Since we know the total is 90 boxes and there are 10 students, that should be straightforward. So average would be 90 divided by 10, which is 9. So A) seems possible. But let's check the others.",

  {
    "text": "The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For 10 students, the median would be the average of the 5th and 6th values. However, to find the median, we need to know the individual values or at least their distribution. But here we just have the total. So if all we know is the total, we can't determine the median because there are many different distributions that could add up to 90. For example, maybe all students sold exactly 9 boxes, making the median 9. Or maybe some sold more and some sold less. The median could vary. So B) probably can't be calculated.",
    "class-1-reason": "The paragraph clearly explains why the median cannot be calculated: it applies reasoning about distributions, giving examples, but with certainty and logical explanation. It is not explorative trial or checking a result, just systematically showing why B cannot be found.",

    "text": "C) The greatest number of boxes sold by one student. Hmm. Without knowing the distribution, can we determine the maximum? Well, the maximum could be as high as 90 if one student sold all 90, and the rest sold 0. But that's an extreme case. Alternatively, if the maximum was lower, like 50, then the others would have to add up to 40. But there's no way to know for sure just from the total. So we can't determine the maximum; it could be any number from 9 up to 90, depending on how the boxes are distributed. So C) can't be calculated.",
    "class-1-reason": "This paragraph methodically assesses whether the maximum value can be known, providing examples to justify its reasoning, but not to postulate alternatives or check previously found results. The analysis proceeds in a confident, stepwise way.",

    "text": "D) The least number of boxes sold by one student. Similar to the maximum, the minimum could be 0 if one student didn't sell any, and the others sold more. Or it could be 9 if everyone sold exactly 9. But again, without specific data, we can't determine the minimum. So D) is out.",
    "class-1-reason": "The solver uses direct reasoning to discuss the minimum in analogy with the previous paragraph, dismissing option D with straightforward analysis. There is no speculative exploration or explicit verification.",

    "text": "So the only one that can be calculated is A) the average. Let me double-check. The average is total divided by number of students, which is given. So 90/10 = 9. So yes, A) is possible. The rest require more information about individual sales, which we don't have. So the answer must be A.</think>The average number of boxes sold per student can be calculated using the total boxes (90) and the number of students (10). The average is \\( \\frac{90}{10} = 9 \\).

    "class-1-reason": "This paragraph explains that with the given total and student count, only the average can be calculated, computes the average explicitly, and reasons that the other options can't be found without more data.
