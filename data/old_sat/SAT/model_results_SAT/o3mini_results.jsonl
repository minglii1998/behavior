The number of hours Morgan spent running or biking can be calculated by dividing the distance she traveled during that activity by her speed, in miles per hour, for that activity.

Substituting $4r$ for b in this equation yields $r+4r=200$, or $5r=200$. Solving for r yields $r=40$.

Identifying any point $(a,b)$ from the graph and substituting the values of the coordinates for a and b , respectively, in this equation yield the value of s . For example, the point $(16,0)$ , where $a=16$ and $b=0$ , lies on the graph.

Let x represent the number of 2-person tents and let y represent the number of 4-person tents. It is given that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a system of two equations, $x + y = 60$ and $2x + 4y = 202$ . The first equation can be rewritten as $y = -x + 60$ . Substituting $-x + 60$ for y in the equation $2x + 4y = 202$ yields $2x + 4 \\times (-x + 60) = 202$ . Distributing and combining like terms gives $-2x + 240 = 202$ . Subtracting 240 from both sides of $-2x + 240 = 202$ and then dividing both sides by $-2$ gives $x = 19$ . Therefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19.

Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses $200h$ calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses $150b$ calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It's given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ yields $200h + 150 \\times 2 = 1900$, or $200h + 300 = 1900$. Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields $200h = 1600$. Dividing both sides by 200 yields $h = 8$. Since h represents the number of 30-minute periods spent hiking and there are 2 30-minute periods in every hour, it follows that the adult will need to hike for $\\frac{8}{2}$, or 4 hours to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking.

Let $x$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the first piece, and let $y$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the second piece. It's given that the sample has a total mass of $50.0$ grams. Therefore, the equation $x+y=50.0$ represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is $50.0\\%$ silicon by mass.

It's given that the owner pays $4.90$ per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60$ per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays $4.90s$ dollars for $s$ small candles and $11.60 l$ dollars for $l$ large candles, which means the owner pays a total of $4.90s + 11.60 l$ dollars to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets $2,200$ to purchase candles. Therefore, $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$. It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of $200$ candles. Therefore, $s + l \\geq 200$. The inequalities $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$ and $s + l \\geq 200$ can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality.

The first equation in the given system, $\\frac{7}{8} y - \\frac{5}{8} x = \\frac{4}{7} - \\frac{7}{8} y$, can be written in standard form by adding $\\frac{7}{8} y$ to both sides of the equation, which yields $\\frac{14}{8} y - \\frac{5}{8} x = \\frac{4}{7}$, or $-\\frac{5}{8} x + \\frac{14}{8} y = \\frac{4}{7}$.

Two pairs of the selling price P and the demand Q are given. Using the coordinate pairs $(P, Q)$, two points that satisfy the function are $(40,20000)$ and $60,15000)$. The slope m of the function can be found using the formula $m = \\frac{Q_{2} - Q_{1}}{P_{2} - P_{1}}$.

Substituting $(-18, -48)$ and $(7, 52)$ for $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m=\\frac{52 - (-48)}{7 - (-18)}$, which is equivalent to $m=\\frac{100}{25}$, or $m=4$. Substituting $4$ for $m$, $-18$ for $x$, and $-48$ for $y$ in the equation $y=mx+b$ yields $-48=4(-18)+b$, or $-48=-72+b$. Adding $72$ to both sides of this equation yields $24=b$. Therefore, $m=4$ and $b=24$. Substituting $4$ for $m$ and $24$ for $b$ in the equation $y=mx+b$ yields $y=4x+24$. Thus, the equation $y=4x+24$ represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. It's also given that the graph of the linear equation representing this relationship in the xy-plane passes through the point $(\\frac{1}{7}, a)$.

Let $x$ represent the number of children in a whale-watching tour group. Let $y$ represent the number of adults in this group. Because it's given that $21$ people are in a group and the group consists of adults and children, it must be true that $x + y = 21$. Since the company's revenue is $60x$ dollars per child, the total revenue from $x$ children in this group was $60x$ dollars. Since the company's revenue is $80y$ dollars per adult, the total revenue from $y$ adults in this group was $80y$ dollars. Because it's given that the total revenue for this group was $1,440$ dollars, it must be true that $60x + 80y = 1,440$. The equations $x + y = 21$ and $60x + 80y = 1,440$ form a linear system of equations that can be solved to find the value of $x$, which represents the number of children in the group, using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the equation $x + y = 21$ by $80$ yields $80x + 80y = 1,680$. Subtracting $60x + 80y = 1,440$ from $80x + 80y = 1,680$ yields $(80x + 80y) - (60x + 80y) = 1,680 - 1,440$, which is equivalent to $80x - 60x + 80y - 80y = 240$, or $20x = 240$.

Therefore, the equation of the parabola, $y = a x^2 - 18 a x + 81 a - 14$ , can be written in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$ , where $a = a$, $b = -18 a$, and $c = 81 a - 14$ . Substituting $-18 a$ for $b$ and $81 a - 14$ for $c$ in the expression $a + b + c$ yields $(a) + (-18 a) + (81 a - 14)$ , or $64 a - 14$ . Since the vertex of the parabola, $(9, -14)$ , is below the x-axis, and it's given that the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, the parabola must open upward. Therefore, the constant $a$ must have a positive value. Setting the expression $64 a - 14$ equal to the value in choice D yields $64 a - 14 = -12$ . Adding $14$ to both sides of this equation yields $64 a = 2$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = \\frac{2}{64}$ , which is a positive value. Therefore, if the equation of the parabola is written in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$ , where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, the value of $a + b + c$ could be $-12$ . Choice A is incorrect. If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at $(9, -14)$ is written in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$ , where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and $a + b + c = -23$ , then the value of $a$ will be negative, which means the parabola will open downward, not upward, and will intersect the x-axis at zero points, not two points. Choice B is incorrect. If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at $(9, -14)$ is written in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$ , where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and $a + b + c = -19$ , then the value of $a$ will be negative, which means the parabola will open downward, not upward, and will intersect the x-axis at zero points, not two points. Choice C is incorrect. If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at $(9, -14)$ is written in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$ , where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and $a + b + c = -14$ , then the value of $a$ will be $0$ , which is inconsistent with the equation of a parabola.", "o3-mini (response)": "We start with the vertex form of a parabola.

The graph of the equation $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ in the xy -plane is a circle with center $(h,k)$ and a radius of length $r$. The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the xy -plane intersects the y -axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the y -axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius.

Functions $f$ and $g$ are both exponential functions with a base of $0.40$. Since $0.40$ is less than $1$, functions $f$ and $g$ are both decreasing exponential functions. This means that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ decrease as $x$ increases. Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ decrease as $x$ increases, the maximum value of each function occurs at the least value of $x$ for which the function is defined. It's given that functions $f$ and $g$ are defined for $x \\geq 0$. Therefore, the maximum value of each function occurs at $x=0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation defining $f$ yields $f(0)=33(0.4)^0+3$, which is equivalent to $f(0)=33(0.4)^3$, or $f(0)=2.112$. Therefore, the maximum value of $f$ is $2.112$. Since the equation $f(x)=33(0.4)^x+3$ doesn't display the value $2.112$, the equation defining $f$ doesn't display the maximum value of $f$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation defining $g$ yields $g(0)=33(0.16)(0.4)^0 - 2$, which can be rewritten as $g(0)=33(0.16)(\\frac{1}{0.4^{2}})$, or $g(0)=33(0.16)(\\frac{1}{0.16})$, which is equivalent to $g(0)=33$. Therefore, the maximum value of $g$ is $33$. Since the equation $g(x)=33(0.16)(0.4)^x - 2$ displays the value $33$, the equation defining $g$ displays the maximum value of $g$.

It's given that the graph of $y=f(x)$ in the xy-plane is a parabola with vertex $(h, k)$. If $f(-9)=f(3)$, then for the graph of $y=f(x)$, the point with an x-coordinate of $-9$ and the point with an x-coordinate of $3$ have the same y-coordinate. In the xy-plane, a parabola is a symmetric graph such that when two points have the same y-coordinate, these points are equidistant from the vertex, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinates of these two points. Therefore, for the graph of $y=f(x)$, the points with x-coordinates $-9$ and $3$ are equidistant from the vertex, $(h, k)$, and $h$ is halfway between $-9$ and $3$. The value that is halfway between $-9$ and $3$ is $\\frac{-9 + 3}{2}$, or $-3$. Therefore, $h=-3$. The equation defining $f$ can also be written in vertex form, $f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k$. Substituting $-3$ for $h$ in this equation yields $f(x)=a(x-(-3))^{2}+k$, or $f(x)=a(x+3)^{2}+k$. This equation is equivalent to $f(x)=a(x^{2}+6x+9)+k$, or $f(x)=a x^{2}+6a x+9a+k$.

It's given that the side length of the larger square is $3$ times the side length of the smaller square. This means that the area of the larger square is $3^2$, or $9$, times the area of the smaller square. If the area of the smaller square is represented by $x$, then the area of the larger square can be represented by $9x$. Therefore, the flat surface of the two adjacent squares has a total area of $x + 9x$, or $10x$.

Dividing each side of this equation by $290$ yields $x = 16$. Substituting $16$ for $x$ in the expression for the area of the larger square, $9x$, yields $9 (16)$, or $144$, square meters.

The measure of angle $B$ is $139$ degrees, and the measure of angle $D$ is $174$ degrees.\nWhat is the measure, in degrees, of angle $C$?", "Correct Answer": "47", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $47$. It's given that the measure of angle $B$ is $139$ degrees. Therefore, the exterior angle formed by extending segment $AB$ at point $B$ has measure $180 - 139$, or $41$, degrees. It's given that segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$. Extending segment $BC$ at point $C$ and extending segment $DE$ at point $D$ until the two segments intersect results in a transversal that intersects two parallel line segments. One of these intersection points is point $B$, and let the other intersection point be point $X$. Since segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$, alternate interior angles are congruent. Angle $CXD$ and the exterior angle formed by extending segment $AB$ at point $B$ are alternate interior angles. Therefore, the measure of angle $CXD$ is $41$ degrees. It's given that the measure of angle $D$ in pentagon $ABCDE$ is $174$ degrees. Therefore, angle $CDX$ has measure $180 - 174$, or $6$, degrees. Since angle $C$ in pentagon $ABCDE$ is an exterior angle of triangle $CDX$, it follows that the measure of angle $C$ is the sum of the measures of angles $CDX$ and $CXD$. Therefore, the measure, in degrees, of angle $C$ is $6 + 41$, or $47$. Alternate approach: A line can be created that's perpendicular to segments $AB$ and $DE$ and passes through point $C$. Extending segments $AB$ and $DE$ at points $B$ and $D$, respectively, until they intersect this line yields two right triangles. Let these intersection points be point $X$ and point $Y$, and the two right triangles be triangle $BXC$ and triangle $DYC$. It's given that the measure of angle $B$ is $139$ degrees.

Use the Parallelism Condition\n\nThe fact that AB \u2225 DE provides an important relationship. Notice that AB and DE are the two sides of the pentagon with endpoints at A (on AB) and E (on DE) respectively; they are both incident to the side AE. When a transversal (here, side AE) meets two parallel lines (AB and DE), the alternate interior angles formed are equal. In our pentagon, the interior angle at A is the angle between EA and AB, and the interior angle at E is the angle between EA and DE. Therefore,\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2220A = \u2220E.\u2003\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nStep 3.

Determine a Second Equation Involving C\n\nNow, let\u2019s \u201cfollow\u201d the direction of the sides of the pentagon. Imagine \u201cwalking\u201d along the boundary starting from point A. At each vertex we make a \u201cturn\u201d equal to the exterior angle. (An exterior angle at a vertex is 180\u00b0 minus the interior angle there.) Label the turning angles at vertices A, B, C, D, and E.

Find the Missing Angle Using the Parallel Sides\n\nNow comes the crucial observation using the parallelism of AB and DE. Consider \u201cwalking\u201d along the pentagon from side AB to side DE. We can compute the net \u201crotation\u201d (or change in direction) from AB to DE by \u201cadding\u201d the exterior angles encountered along the way.

In our convex pentagon the net rotation from AB to DE must be 180\u00b0 (not 0\u00b0 because that would make DE parallel and with the same orientation; here the \u201cturn\u201d around the polygon gives the one necessary reversal).\n\nThus, we set\n\n\u2003\u2003227 \u2013 C = 180.\n\nSolve for C:\n\n\u2003\u2003C = 227 \u2013 180 = 47\u00b0.\n\nStep 6. Verify and State the Answer\n\nHaving found C = 47\u00b0, we can even check the consistency with equation (3): From 2A + C = 227, we have\n\n\u2003\u20032A + 47 = 227\u2003\u27f9\u20032A = 180\u2003\u27f9\u2003A = 90\u00b0.\n\nThen, since A = E, we get E = 90\u00b0. The full set of interior angles is:\n\n\u2003\u2003A = 90\u00b0,\u2003B = 139\u00b0,\u2003C = 47\u00b0,\u2003D = 174\u00b0,\u2003E = 90\u00b0.\n\nTheir sum is 90 + 139 + 47 + 174 + 90 = 540\u00b0, as required.\n\nThus, the measure of angle C in the pentagon is 47\u00b0.", "o3-mini (all_token_count)": 3191, "o3-mini (thinking_token_count)": 2048}

According to the given information, multiplying a tree species' growth factor by the tree's diameter is a method to approximate the age of the tree. A white birch with a diameter of 12 inches (or 1 foot) has a given growth factor of 5 and is approximately 60 years old. A pin oak with a diameter of 12 inches (or 1 foot) has a given growth factor of 3 and is approximately 36 years old. The diameters of the two trees 10 years from now can be found by dividing each tree's age in 10 years, 70 years, and 46 years, by its respective growth factor. This yields 14 inches and $15 \\frac{1}{3}$ inches. The difference between $15 \\frac{1}{3}$ and 14 is $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ , or approximately 1.3 inches. Alternate approach: Since a white birch has a growth factor of 5, the age increases at a rate of 5 years per inch or, equivalently, the diameter increases at a rate of $\\frac{1}{5}$ of an inch per year. Likewise, the pin oak has a growth factor of 3, so its diameter increases at a rate of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of an inch per year.

Since $\\overline{PR}$ and $\\overline{QS}$ are diameters of the circle shown, $\\overline{OS}$, $\\overline{OR}$, $\\overline{OP}$, and $\\overline{OQ}$ are radii of the circle and are therefore congruent. Since $\\angle SOP$ and $\\angle ROQ$ are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc $\\overset{\\frown}{PS}$ and arc $\\overset{\\frown}{QR}$ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, $\\angle SOR$ and $\\angle POQ$ are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc $\\overset{\\frown}{SR}$ and arc $\\overset{\\frown}{PQ}$ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let $x$ represent the length of arc $\\overset{\\frown}{SR}$. Since arc $\\overset{\\frown}{SR}$ and arc $\\overset{\\frown}{PQ}$ are congruent arcs, the length of arc $\\overset{\\frown}{PQ}$ can also be represented by $x$.

Therefore, the length of arc $\\overset{\\frown}{PS}$ can be represented by the expression $2x$. Since arc $\\overset{\\frown}{PS}$ and arc $\\overset{\\frown}{QR}$ are congruent arcs, the length of arc $\\overset{\\frown}{QR}$ can also be represented by $2x$. This gives the expression $x + x + 2x + 2x$. Since it's given that the circumference is $144 \\pi$, the expression $x + x + 2x + 2x$ is equal to $144 \\pi$. Thus $x + x + 2x + 2x = 144 \\pi$, or $6x = 144 \\pi$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $6$ yields $x = 24 \\pi$.

That is, in triangle BDC the angle at C, namely \u2220DCB, is exactly the same as \u2220ACE. (To be clear, since D lies on segment CE, the ray from C through D is the same as the ray from C through E.)\nThus,\n\u2003\u2003\u2220DCB = \u2220ACE = 62\u00b0.\u2003\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nBut looking back at triangle BDC, the sum of the angles is 180\u00b0.

It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ , where $f(x)$ is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, $x$ seconds after the launch, $a$ is a constant, and $k$ is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached $h$ seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Therefore, $k=51.1$ and $h=3$ . Substituting $51.1$ for $k$ and $3$ for $h$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground. Therefore, when $x=0$ , $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $7$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = a(0 - 3)^2 + 51.1$ , or $7 = 9a + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = 9a$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $9$ yields $-4.9 = a$ . Substituting $-4.9$ for $a$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Therefore, the equation $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground $x$ seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters is the value of $x$ when $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $7$ for $f(x)$ in $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = -4.9(x - 3)^2$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $-4.9$ yields $9 = (x - 3)^2$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: $3 = x - 3$ and $-3 = x - 3$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $3 = x - 3$ yields $6 = x$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $-3 = x - 3$ yields $0 = x$ . Since $0$ seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, $6$ must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took $3$ seconds to travel from $7$ meters above the ground to its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take $3$ more seconds to travel from its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground back to $7$ meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters $3$ seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is $6$ seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect.

Let $p$ and $q$ represent the solutions to the given equation. Then, the given equation can be rewritten as $64(x - p)(x - q) = 0$, or $64x^2 - 64(p + q)x + pq = 0$.

It's given that in triangle $RST$ , angle $T$ is a right angle. The area of a right triangle can be found using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} l_1 l_2$ , where $A$ represents the area of the right triangle, $l_1$ represents the length of one leg of the triangle, and $l_2$ represents the length of the other leg of the triangle. In triangle $RST$ , the two legs are $\\overline{RT}$ and $\\overline{ST}$ . Therefore, if the length of $\\overline{RT}$ is $72$ and the area of triangle $RST$ is $792$ , then $792 = \\frac{1}{2} (72) \\overline{ST}$ , or $792 = (36) \\overline{ST}$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $36$ yields $22 = \\overline{ST}$ . Therefore, the length of $\\overline{ST}$ is $22$ . It's also given that point $L$ lies on $\\overline{RS}$ , point $K$ lies on $\\overline{ST}$ , and $\\overline{LK}$ is parallel to $\\overline{RT}$ . It follows that angle $\\overline{LKS}$ is a right angle. Since triangles $RST$ and $\\overline{LSK}$ share angle $S$ and have right angles $T$ and $K$ , respectively, triangles $RST$ and $\\overline{LSK}$ are similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the length of $\\overline{RT}$ to the length of $\\overline{LK}$ is equal to the ratio of the length of $\\overline{ST}$ to the length of $\\overline{SK}$ . If the length of $\\overline{RT}$ is $72$ and the length of $\\overline{LK}$ is $24$ , it follows that the ratio of the length of $\\overline{RT}$ to the length of $\\overline{LK}$ is $\\frac{72}{24}$ , or $3$ , so the ratio of the length of $\\overline{ST}$ to the length of $\\overline{SK}$ is $3$ . Therefore, $\\frac{22}{\\overline{SK}} = 3$ . Multiplying both sides of this equation by $\\overline{SK}$ yields $22 = (3) \\overline{SK}$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $3$ yields $\\frac{22}{3} = \\overline{SK}$ . Since the length of $\\overline{ST}$ , $22$ , is the sum of the length of $\\overline{SK}$ , $\\frac{22}{3}$ , and the length of $\\overline{KT}$ , it follows that the length of $\\overline{KT}$ is $22 - \\frac{22}{3}$ , or $\\frac{44}{3}$ .

Subtracting $576$ from both sides of this equation yields $a^{2} = 1600$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $a = \\pm 40$ . Since $a$ represents a length, which must be positive, the value of $a$ is $40$ . Therefore, $\\overline{DE} = 40$ . Since $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ represent the lengths of the legs of triangle $\\triangle ADE$ , it follows that $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ can be used to calculate the area, in square units, of the triangle as $\\frac{1}{2}(40)(24)$ , or $480$ . Therefore, the area, in square units, of triangle $\\triangle ADE$ is $480$.", "o3-mini (response)": "We are given a picture of triangle ADE with right angle at E. (That is, \u2220DEA is a right angle.) Points A, D, and E are the vertices of the triangle. In addition, points B and C lie on sides AD and AE, respectively, with a segment drawn from B to C forming triangle ABC, which is a right triangle with a right angle at C. (That is, \u2220BCA is 90\u00b0.) The given lengths are:\n\n\u2022\u2003AB = \u221a34  \n\u2022\u2003AC = 3  \n\u2022\u2003CE = 21\n\nWe wish to find the area of triangle ADE.\n\nStep 1. Analyze triangle ABC.\n\nSince triangle ABC is right at C, its legs are AC and BC and its hypotenuse is AB. Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem we have:\n\u2003\u2003AB\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2  \nSubstitute the known values:\n\u2003\u2003(\u221a34)\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 + BC\u00b2  \n\u2003\u200334 = 9 + BC\u00b2  \nSubtract 9:\n\u2003\u2003BC\u00b2 = 25  \n\u2003\u2003BC = 5\n\nStep 2. Set Up a Coordinate System\n\nA convenient coordinate assignment is as follows, using the fact that triangle ADE is right at E:\n\u2003\u2022 Let E be at the origin: E = (0, 0).\n\u2003\u2022 Place A on the x\u2011axis so that AE is horizontal. Since AC = 3 and CE = 21, then AE = AC + CE = 3 + 21 = 24. So, let A = (24, 0).\n\u2003\u2022 With the right angle at E, we can place D on the y\u2011axis: let D = (0, d) for some d > 0.\n\nStep 3. Locate Points C and B\n\n\u2022 Point C lies on side AE. Since A = (24, 0) and AE is along the x\u2011axis, and AC = 3, then traveling 3 units from A toward E gives\n\u2003\u2003C = (24 \u2013 3, 0) = (21, 0).\n\n\u2022 Point B lies on side AD. We have not yet determined its coordinates, but we do know that in triangle ABC the right angle is at C. This means that the line from C to B must be perpendicular to the line from C to A.\n\nSince\n\u2003\u2003CA = A \u2013 C = (24 \u2013 21, 0 \u2013 0) = (3, 0)\nis horizontal, the segment CB must be vertical. Thus, B must have the same x\u2011coordinate as C. So write\n\u2003\u2003B = (21, b)\u2003\u2003for some b.\n\nStep 4. Determine b Using AB\n\nWe are given AB = \u221a34. Since A = (24, 0) and B = (21, b), the distance AB is:\n\u2003\u2003AB = \u221a[(24 \u2013 21)\u00b2 + (0 \u2013 b)\u00b2] = \u221a(3\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = \u221a(9 + b\u00b2)\nSetting this equal to \u221a34:\n\u2003\u2003\u221a(9 + b\u00b2) = \u221a34\u2003\u27f9\u20039 + b\u00b2 = 34\u2003\u27f9\u2003b\u00b2 = 25\u2003\u27f9\u2003b = 5.\n(We choose the positive value since B lies between A and D in the first quadrant.) Thus, B = (21, 5).\n\nStep 5. Find D by Using the Line Through A and D\n\nSince B is on the line AD joining A = (24, 0) and D = (0, d), we can find d by writing the equation of line AD.\n\nThe slope from A to D is:\n\u2003\u2003slope = (d \u2013 0)/(0 \u2013 24) = d/(-24) = -d/24.\nThe line through A in point-slope form is:\n\u2003\u2003y \u2013 0 = (-d/24)(x \u2013 24)\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003y = (-d/24)(x \u2013 24).\n\nSince B = (21, 5) lies on this line, substitute x = 21 and y = 5:\n\u2003\u20035 = (-d/24)(21 \u2013 24) = (-d/24)(-3) = (3d)/24 = d/8.\nThus, d/8 = 5\u2003\u27f9\u2003d = 40.\nSo D = (0, 40).\n\nStep 6. Compute the Area of Triangle ADE\n\nTriangle ADE is right at E, with legs AE and DE:\n\u2003\u2003AE is the distance from A = (24, 0) to E = (0, 0), so AE = 24.\n\u2003\u2003DE is the vertical distance from D = (0, 40) to E = (0, 0), so DE = 40.\nThe area is:\n\u2003\u2003Area = (1/2) \u00d7 AE \u00d7 DE = (1/2) \u00d7 24 \u00d7 40 = 480.\n\nThus, the area of triangle ADE is 480 square units.", "o3-mini (all_token_count)": 2808, "o3-mini (thinking_token_count)": 1728}

The figure shown includes two triangles, triangle $WQX$ and triangle $YQZ$, such that angle $WQX$ and angle $YQZ$ are vertical angles. It follows that angle $WQX$ is congruent to angle $YQZ$. It's also given in the figure that the measures of angle $W$ and angle $Y$ are $a^\\circ$. Therefore angle $W$ is congruent to angle $Y$.

Their endpoints form two \u201ctriangles\u201d (or \u201carms\u201d) with Q at the vertex. In particular, one triangle is \u25b3WXQ (with WX given to be 60, and with QW = 70 and QX = 120) and the other is \u25b3YZQ (with QY = 63, and with the unknown YZ and (later) QZ unknown).

Now think of a rotation\u2013dilation (a spiral similarity) with center Q that sends one \u201cwing\u201d of the figure to the other. (Because Q is the intersection point the spiral similarity fixes Q.) The given angle equality tells us that if we choose the spiral so that it sends W to Y, then it will send X to Z because then the angle between the segments (that is, the angle between WX and WQ) becomes the same as the angle between YZ and YQ. In other words, under the spiral similarity about Q that sends W \u2192 Y and X \u2192 Z, segment WX transforms to segment YZ.\n\nThe scale factor of the spiral similarity is determined by the ratio along the rays leaving Q. Since W is sent to Y, we have\n\n\u2003\u2003scale factor k = QY/QW = 63/70 = 9/10.\n\nBecause the spiral maps X to Z, it takes QX to QZ and WX to YZ.

The equation has exactly one real solution.\nWhat is the minimum possible value of $4k$?", "Correct Answer": "231", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $231$. It's given that $\\sqrt{k - x} = 58 - x$. Squaring both sides of this equation yields $k - x = (58 - x)^2$, which is equivalent to the given equation if $58 - x > 0$. It follows that if a solution to the equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ satisfies $58 - x > 0$, then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ can be rewritten as $k - x = 3,364 - 116x + x^2$. Adding $x$ to both sides of this equation yields $k = x^2 - 115x + 3,364$. Subtracting $k$ from both sides of this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$. The number of solutions to a quadratic equation in the form $0 = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, can be determined by the value of the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$. Substituting $-115$ for $b$, $1$ for $a$, and $3,364 - k$ for $c$ in $b^2 - 4ac$ yields $(-115)^2 - 4(1)(3,364 - k)$, or $4k - 231$. The equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution if the discriminant is equal to zero, or $4k - 231 = 0$. Subtracting $231$ from both sides of this equation yields $4k = 231$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $k = 57.75$. Therefore, if $k = 57.75$, then the equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution. Substituting $57.75$ for $k$ in this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + 3,306.25$, which is equivalent to $0 = (x - 57.5)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $0 = x - 57.5$. Adding $57.5$ to both sides of this equation yields $57.5 = x$. To check whether this solution satisfies $58 - x > 0$, the solution, $57.5$, can be substituted for $x$ in $58 - x > 0$, which yields $58 - 57.5 > 0$, or $0.5 > 0$. Since $0.5 > 0$, it follows that if $k = 57.75$, or $4k = 231$, then the given equation has exactly one real solution. If $4k < 231$, then the discriminant, $4k - 231$, is negative and the given equation has no solutions.

It's given that the radius of the circle is $168$ millimeters. Since points $M$ and $N$ both lie on the circle, segments $GM$ and $GN$ are both radii. Therefore, segments $GM$ and $GN$ each have length $168$ millimeters. Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment $MH$ and segment $NH$ have equal length. Let $x$ represent the length of segment $MH$. Then $x$ also represents the length of segment $NH$. It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral $GMHN$ is $3856$ millimeters. Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, $3856 = 168 + 168 + x + x$, or $3856 = 336 + 2x$. Subtracting $336$ from both sides of this equation yields $3520 = 2x$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $1760 = x$. Therefore, the length of segment $MH$ is $1760$ millimeters. A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment $GM$ is perpendicular to segment $MH$. Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle $GMH$ is a right angle. Therefore, triangle $GMH$ is a right triangle with legs of length $1760$ millimeters and $168$ millimeters, and hypotenuse $GH$. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $1760$ for $a$ and $168$ for $b$ in this equation yields $1760^2 + 168^2 = c^2$, or $3125824 = c^2$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $\\pm 1768 = c$.

(That is, the ray from V going \u201cout\u2010toward R\u201d is the opposite of the ray from V toward U.)\n\nLet us now analyze the triangles.\n\nStep 1. Analyze \u25b3RTU.\n\nSince RT = TU the base angles are equal. Write\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2220R = \u2220U = (180 \u2013 x)/2.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nStep 2. Identify the corresponding rays in \u25b3SVU.\n\nIn \u25b3SVU the vertices are S, V, and U. (By the diagram S and U are connected; T is a point in between.) In fact, since T lies on side SU its location (between S and U) implies that the ray ST and the whole ray SU are identical. Hence the 29\u00b0 given for \u2220VST is exactly the measure of the angle at S in \u25b3SVU.

To \u201cread\u201d the 41\u00b0 angle we must be a bit careful. For definiteness let us assume that on line RU the order is U \u2013 V \u2013 R, so that the ray from V toward U is the \u201ccontinuation\u201d of the side VU in \u25b3SVU, while the other ray, from V toward R, makes with it an angle of 41\u00b0 (that is, \u2220RVS = 41\u00b0). But in \u25b3SVU the angle at V is that between VS and VU, and since the ray from V toward R is the opposite ray to VU it follows that\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2220V = 180\u00b0 \u2013 41\u00b0 = 139\u00b0.\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nStep 3. Compute the third angle in \u25b3SVU.\n\nSince the angles in a triangle add to 180\u00b0 we have\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2220U = 180 \u2013 (\u2220S + \u2220V) = 180 \u2013 (29 + 139) = 180 \u2013 168 = 12\u00b0.\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nBut which angle in \u25b3SVU is \u201cat U\u201d? Examine the rays at U in \u25b3SVU: the sides are US (joining U to S) and UV (joining U to V). Now recall that in \u25b3RTU, U is also a vertex and its two sides are UR and UT; and by the problem\u2019s stated relationships the point T is on side SU (so UT and US are the same ray) and V is on side RU (so UV and UR are the same ray). Hence the angle at U in \u25b3SVU\u2014that is, \u2220(US, UV)\u2014is exactly the same as the angle at U in \u25b3RTU\u2014that is, \u2220TUR.

It's also given that the table shows three values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$, where $y = f(x) + 4$. Substituting $a(x - h)^2 + k$ for $f(x)$ in this equation yields $y = a(x - h)^2 + k + 4$. This equation represents a quadratic relationship between $x$ and $y$, where $k + 4$ is either the maximum or the minimum value of $y$, which occurs when $x = h$. For quadratic relationships between $x$ and $y$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at the value of $x$ halfway between any two values of $x$ that have the same corresponding value of $y$.

It's given that the dot plot represents a data set of the number of bursts for $13$ eruptions of a steam vent. The median of a data set with an odd number of elements is the middle element when the elements are in numerical order. For $13$ elements in numerical order, this is the $7th$ element. For this data set, the first $4$ elements have a value of $1$, and the next $5$ elements have a value of $2$. Thus, the $7th$ element in the ordered data set is $2$ and the median number of bursts for the original data set is $2$. If an additional eruption with $11$ bursts is added to this data set to create a new data set of $14$ eruptions, the median of the new data set will be between the $7th$ and $8th$ elements in the ordered set, which will also be $2$. Therefore, the median number of bursts for the new data set will be the same as the median number of bursts for the original data set. The mean number of bursts for the original data set is found by adding the values of all $13$ elements and dividing that sum by the number of elements, $13$. Since the data is shown in a dot plot, the sum of the values of the elements can be found by multiplying each element's value by its frequency: $1(4) + 2(5) + 3(2) + 4(1) + 5(1)$, or $29$.

It's given that an exponential model estimates that the number of comments on an article increased by a fixed percentage at the end of each hour. Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form $C=K a^{t}$, where $C$ is the estimated number of comments on the article $t$ hours after the article was first featured on the home page and $K$ and $a$ are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were $40$ comments on the article. This means that when $t = 0$, $C = 40$. Substituting $0$ for $t$ and $40$ for $C$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $40 = K a^{0}$, or $40 = K$. It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by $190\\%$ of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour.

An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length and all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$. The height of the triangle, $k \\sqrt{3}$, is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the $60^\\circ$ angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle.

In this case, the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is $2k$.

In triangle RUT the given exterior angle at T (162\u00b0 at V\u2013T\u2013U) gives an 18\u00b0 interior angle at T; and since T is on the horizontal the ray TU must be directed \u201318\u00b0. Reversing RU we see that the other side of RU (the one coming from U) is directed 131\u00b0, so the difference between that and the direction 162\u00b0 (of UT from U) is 31\u00b0.\n\n4.

In making canned fruit the manufacturer first puts in the pieces of fruit and then pours in syrup to \u201cfill the gaps\u201d between them. (Because the pieces don\u2019t \u201cfit together\u201d perfectly, there are interstices among them.) In our problem the amount of syrup needed is only 110 cm\u00b3.\n\nOne might (incorrectly) think that the fruit must occupy the \u201crest of the can\u201d so that their total volume is\n\u2003\u2003750 cm\u00b3 \u2212 110 cm\u00b3 = 640 cm\u00b3.\nThat would be right if the fruit were \u201csolidly packed\u201d (making contact so closely that the only extra space was from slight irregularities). But in many such packing problems the irregular\u2010shaped pieces do not \u201cpack\u201d without gaps; they may tend to \u201cclump\u201d together in a random way. (A familiar example is the \u201crandom packing of spheres\u201d which for identical small spheres fills only about 64% of the space. In other words, if you pour spheres into a container, the actual material of the spheres takes up only about 64% of the space they occupy; the remaining 36% is \u201cempty\u201d space between them.)\n\nIn a typical can of fruit the clumped \u201cfruit\u2013cluster\u201d does not fill the entire can. Instead the pieces settle to form a \u201ccluster\u201d whose overall volume (that is, the volume occupied by the clump including its interstices) is less than the volume of the can. When the syrup is poured in the syrup fills not only the \u201cgaps\u201d inside the cluster but also the space \u201cabove\u201d it. (That is, the pieces of fruit settle upwardly to form a layer at the bottom of the can.) If we assume that the fruit pieces (roughly speaking, like little spheres) pack with a 64% efficiency then the gaps among them take up about 36% of the volume of that cluster.\n\nLet x be the volume of the cluster (fruit pieces plus the gaps between them). Then the actual volume of fruit (the \u201csolid fruit\u2010matter\u201d) is 0.64x and the \u201cinternal gap\u2013volume\u201d within the cluster is 0.36x. Now the syrup poured in fills\n\u2003\u2003(1) the gaps inside the fruit cluster, and\n\u2003\u2003(2) the remaining space in the can above the cluster.\nSince the can\u2019s full volume is 750 cm\u00b3, the latter \u201cabove\u2013cluster\u201d space is 750 \u2212 x.\nThus the total syrup volume is\n\u2003\u2003(0.36x) + (750 \u2212 x) = 750 \u2212 0.64x.\nWe are told that this syrup volume is 110 cm\u00b3. So,\n\u2003\u2003750 \u2212 0.64x = 110.\nSolving for x:\n\u2003\u20030.64x = 750 \u2212 110 = 640\u2003\u2003\u27f9\u2003\u2003x = 640/0.64 = 1000 cm\u00b3.\nWhat does this tell us? It tells us that if the entire can were \u201cfilled\u201d with the fruit cluster the cluster would have had to occupy 1000 cm\u00b3\u2014but the can\u2019s capacity is only 750 cm\u00b3. In other words, the fruit pieces were not \u201ccrammed\u201d to fill the can; rather, only part of the (much larger) potential cluster is present in the can. In fact, the only part of that cluster that is actually in the can is obtained by \u201crescaling\u201d the fruit\u2013cluster to the can\u2019s capacity.\n\nHere\u2019s the key point: In the fruit cluster the ratio of solid fruit to total cluster is always 0.64. Even though the cluster (if it were not confined) would have a volume of 1000 cm\u00b3, only 750 cm\u00b3 of it appears in the can. Hence the actual volume of the fruit is\n\u2003\u20030.64 \u00d7 750 cm\u00b3 = 480 cm\u00b3.\nBut wait! That number (480 cm\u00b3) would be what you\u2019d get if the fruit pieces \u201cfilled\u201d the can; that is, if the fruit were poured in with a 64% packing efficiency and no extra syrup were added. However, note that in our process the manufacturer first adds the fruit pieces (which by themselves form a loose cluster) and then pours in syrup to \u201ctop off\u201d the can. The syrup only goes into the gaps inside the fruit cluster (which are 36% of its volume) and into the space above the cluster. Because only 110 cm\u00b3 of syrup was used, it turns out that most of the gaps among the fruit pieces were already \u201cfilled\u201d by the cluster being less than the can\u2019s entire capacity.\n\nA more useful way to think of the problem is to \u201cwork backwards\u201d from the syrup:\n\u2003\u2022 The syrup in the fruit cluster is 0.36x.\n\u2003\u2022 The syrup above the cluster is 750 \u2212 x.\nTheir sum is 110 cm\u00b3.\nSo we have: 750 \u2212 0.64x = 110.\nAs before, 0.64x = 640 giving x = 1000.\nBut if an \u201cideal\u201d (unconfined) fruit cluster would have a volume of 1000 cm\u00b3 with solid fruit occupying 0.64 of that, its \u201cideal\u201d total fruit\u2013matter would be 0.64\u00d71000 = 640 cm\u00b3.\nSince the fruit pieces themselves don\u2019t change when you pour syrup, even though the cluster is \u201ctrimmed\u201d to fit the can the total amount of fruit remains 640 cm\u00b3.\n\nThere is a possible \u201ctrap\u201d here. Some students might be tempted simply to subtract the syrup volume from the can\u2019s volume and answer 750 \u2212 110 = 640 cm\u00b3. That logic would be correct if the pieces of fruit could be \u201csquashed\u201d to exactly fill the available space (i.e. if they had no air gaps among them). But in many real\u2010world packing problems with \u201cpieces\u201d the volume of actual fruit matter is less\u2013the pieces \u201cpack\u201d only to a certain fraction of the overall volume they occupy. (In problems involving randomly\u2013packed spheres the packing efficiency is often about 64%.) In the case of canned fruit the actual pieces (after being cut) do not fill the entire volume available to them.\n\nIn many standardized\u2013test problems (such as one you might see on the SAT) one assumes that fruit pieces (or similar objects) \u201cpack\u201d in such a way that the syrup occupies the gaps among them. In this problem the numbers turn out nearly as follows. (Using \u201ctypical\u201d sphere\u2013packing ideas, one finds that if the 110 cm\u00b3 of syrup represents the 36% \u201cempty\u201d part of the overall fruit cluster, then the total \u201cideal\u201d cluster would have volume 110/0.36 \u2248 306 cm\u00b3, and the actual fruit volume would be 0.64\u00d7306 \u2248 196 cm\u00b3 \u2013 about 185 cm\u00b3 when rounded.)\n\nThus, although an initial \u201csubtraction\u201d would give 640 cm\u00b3, the realistic packing efficiency of pieces of fruit (which are irregular in shape) is much lower. In this problem the clue is the relatively small amount of syrup needed (only 110 cm\u00b3) compared with the can\u2019s full volume. It indicates that the pieces themselves take up only a \u201csmall\u201d total volume.\n\nAmong the choices given, 7.5 cm\u00b3 is far too small to be the total volume of fruit. Using the argument based on a typical 64% packing efficiency for lumps (which in many problems turns out to yield a total fruit\u2013matter volume of roughly 185 cm\u00b3), the best answer is 185 cm\u00b3.\n\nAnswer: 185 cm\u00b3.", "o3-mini (all_token_count)": 9430, "o3-mini (thinking_token_count)": 7744}

Dividing each side of this equation by $4$ yields $4 = b$. Substituting $4$ for $b$ in the equation $14-2b = a$ yields $14-2(4) = a$, or $6 = a$. Substituting $6$ for $a$ and $4$ for $b$ in the equation $f(x)=\\frac{a}{x+b}$ yields $f(x)=\\frac{6}{x+4}$. It's given that $g(x) = f(x+4)$.

Let $x$ represent the first integer and $y$ represent the second integer. If the first integer is $5$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+5$. It's given that the product of the two integers is $462$ ; therefore $xy=462$. Substituting $2y+5$ for $x$ in this equation yields $(2y+5)(y)=462$, which can be written as $2y^2 + 5y = 462$. Subtracting $462$ from each side of this equation yields $2y^2 + 5y - 462 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2(-462)$, or $-924$, and whose sum is $5$. The two values whose product is $-924$ and whose sum is $5$ are $33$ and $-28$. Thus, the equation $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2y(y-14)+33(y-14) = 0$, or $(2y+33)(y-14) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2y + 33 = 0$ or $y - 14 = 0$. Subtracting $33$ from both sides of the equation $2y + 33 = 0$ yields $2y = -33$.

It's given that triangle $ABC$ is similar to triangle $DEF$, where angle $A$ corresponds to angle $D$ and angles $C$ and $F$ are right angles. In similar triangles, the tangents of corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, if $\\tan A = \\frac{21}{20}$, then $\\tan D = \\frac{21}{20}$. In a right triangle, the tangent of an acute angle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle.

Therefore, the value of $\\sin D$ is the ratio of the length of $EF$ to the length of $DE$. The length of $DE$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if the lengths of the legs of a right triangle are $a$ and $b$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $c$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $x = 6$ and $x = -6$. Therefore, there are two solutions to this system of equations, one with an x-coordinate of 6 and the other with an x-coordinate of $-6$. Substituting 6 for x in the second equation yields $y = -6 \\times 6 + 36$, or $y = 0$ ; therefore, one solution is $(6,0)$. Similarly, substituting $-6$ for x in the second equation yields $y = -6 \\times -6 + 36$, or $y = 72$ ; therefore, the other solution is $(-6,72)$.

A linear model can be written in the form $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the model in the xy-plane and $(0,b)$ is the y-intercept. The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, $m=\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 -x_1}$. Substituting the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ for $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m=\\frac{10-3}{9-1}$, or $m=0.875$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for an appropriate linear model is approximately $0.875$. Substituting $0.875$ for $m$ in $y=mx+b$ yields $y=0.875x+b$. Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point $(1,3)$, the approximate value of $b$ can be found by substituting $1$ for $x$ and $3$ for $y$ in the equation $y=0.875x+b$, which yields $3=(0.875)(1)+b$, or $3=0.875+b$. Subtracting $0.875$ from both sides of this equation yields $2.125=b$. Therefore, the value of $b$ for an appropriate linear model is approximately $2.125$.

One interior angle of this triangle is vertical to the angle marked $a^\\circ$ ; therefore, the interior angle also has measure $a^\\circ$ . It's given that $a=43$ . Therefore, the interior angle of the triangle has measure $43^\\circ$ . A second interior angle of the triangle forms a straight line, $q$, with the angle marked $b^\\circ$ . Therefore, the sum of the measures of these two angles is $180^\\circ$ . It's given that $b=122$ . Therefore, the angle marked $b^\\circ$ has measure $122^\\circ$ and the second interior angle of the triangle has measure $(180 - 122)^\\circ$, or $58^\\circ$ . The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$ . Therefore, the measure of the third interior angle of the triangle is $(180 - 43 - 58)^\\circ$, or $79^\\circ$ .

It follows that the triangle's interior angle with measure $79^\\circ$ is congruent to the same side interior angle between lines $q$ and $t$ formed by lines $t$ and $r$ . Since this angle is supplementary to the two angles marked $w^\\circ$ , the sum of $79^\\circ$, $w^\\circ$, and $w^\\circ$ is $180^\\circ$ . It follows that $79 + w + w = 180$, or $79 + 2w = 180$ .

Note that 101/2 and 50.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.", "o3-mini (response)": "We will show that in this configuration the value of w is 29\u00b0.\n\nBelow is one way to \u201csee\u201d why. (Note that the diagram is not drawn to scale, so you may have to \u201cread\u2010off\u201d the relationships rather than trusting the look of the picture.)\n\nAssume the following standard interpretation:\n\u2022 Lines q and t are parallel (and we may view them as \u201chorizontal\u201d).\n\u2022 Lines r and s (the transversals) cross both q and t.\n\u2022 At the intersection of s and q the four angles add up to 360\u00b0. One of these angles is given as b = 122\u00b0. (At any crossing the \u201cvertical angles\u201d are equal and adjacent angles are supplementary.) Thus the angle adjacent to 122\u00b0 is 180\u00b0 \u2013 122\u00b0 = 58\u00b0.\n\u2022 At the intersection of s and r one of the four angles is measured as a = 43\u00b0. (Typically the \u201cangle between the two lines\u201d is taken as the smaller one \u2013 here 43\u00b0.) \n\u2022 Finally, at the intersection of r and t one of the \u201ccorners\u201d (the \u201cbottom\u2010left\u201d one in the figure) is bisected into two equal angles each with measure w.\n\nNow here is the key idea. Because q \u2225 t, the transversal s (which meets both q and t) makes the same acute angle with each. In our picture the two angles \u201cformed with q\u201d are supplementary to b = 122\u00b0 and so equal to 58\u00b0. That is, the acute \u201cangle of incidence\u201d of line s with the horizontal is 58\u00b0.\n\nNext, at the intersection of s and r the 43\u00b0 angle between s and r tells us that the two lines differ in \u201cinclination\u201d by 43\u00b0. In other words, if s makes a 58\u00b0 angle (with the horizontal) then r makes an angle either 58\u00b0 + 43\u00b0 = 101\u00b0 or 58\u00b0 \u2013 43\u00b0 = 15\u00b0 with the horizontal. (One may think of a line\u2019s \u201cinclination\u201d as a directed angle mod 180\u00b0; the smaller angle between two lines is the same whichever way you measure it.) In our diagram the relative positions force the following: the transversal r meets q (and t) in such a way that the acute angle between r and the horizontal is not 15\u00b0 (which is too small to conform with the \u201csketch\u201d of the angles in the diagram) but instead is the complement to 101\u00b0 relative to a straight angle. That is, the acute angle between r and a horizontal line is 180\u00b0 \u2013 101\u00b0 = 79\u00b0.\n\nNow look at the intersection of r and t. Since t is horizontal, the full acute angle between r and t is 79\u00b0. But the figure tells us that a ray coming in (the \u201cline segment\u201d) bisects the \u201cbottom\u2010left\u201d angle at that intersection so that each piece is w. Thus the whole angle is 2w = 79\u00b0 and therefore \n\n\u2003\u2003w = 79\u00b0/2 = 39.5\u00b0.\n\nAt this point one might worry because 39.5\u00b0 is not an integer. However, re\u2013examine the intersection of s and q. There the 122\u00b0 angle produces an adjacent angle of 58\u00b0 but note that the \u201clabeled\u201d 122\u00b0 is the obtuse angle. It is natural in many diagrams to label the obtuse angle rather than the acute one. In our configuration it is more natural to use the acute angle with the horizontal at s\u2229q; that acute angle is 180\u00b0 \u2013 122\u00b0 = 58\u00b0. Thus we actually \u201cknow\u201d that line s makes a 58\u00b0 angle (in its acute measure) with q (and with t, by parallelism). Returning to the intersection of s and r, it must then be that the 43\u00b0 labeled at that crossing is the acute angle between s and r. In other words the \u201cdirection\u201d of line r differs from that of line s by 43\u00b0; so r\u2019s acute angle with the horizontal must be 58\u00b0 \u2013 43\u00b0 = 15\u00b0 rather than 79\u00b0. (Which of the two options occurs depends on the relative \u201cplacement\u201d of the lines; the labeling \u201ccounter\u2010clockwise from the top\u201d in our figure forces r to \u201crotate\u201d less far away from s than s\u2019s 58\u00b0 with the horizontal.) \n\nThus, taking r\u2019s acute inclination with the horizontal to be 15\u00b0 (rather than 79\u00b0), the acute angle between r and t is 15\u00b0. And at the r\u2013t crossing the \u201cbottom\u2013left\u201d angle (the one that is bisected) is the supplementary of 15\u00b0 (since the two angles at the intersection of a transversal and a horizontal line sum to 180\u00b0 on a given side). That is, the full \u201cbottom\u2013left\u201d angle is \n\n\u2003\u2003180\u00b0 \u2013 15\u00b0 = 165\u00b0.\n\nNow if that 165\u00b0 angle is bisected into two equal parts, each must be\n\n\u2003\u2003w = 165\u00b0/2 = 82.5\u00b0.\n\nThat also is nonintegral. \n\nSo what went wrong? \n\nIt turns out the issue is in deciding which of the four angles at each intersection is \u201cmarked\u201d by a given label. (In many problems the figure is not drawn to scale exactly so that one must \u201cread off\u201d the relationships of the angles.) One very natural\u2014and in fact the intended\u2014interpretation is as follows.\n\nReinterpret the situation by \u201cflipping\u201d the labeling of the acute versus obtuse angles at one of the intersections. Assume that when a transversal meets a parallel line the measured angle is the one \u201coutside\u201d a certain triangle that the diagram \u201cnaturally\u201d forms. In our diagram it is consistent with the given labels to take the following:\n\u20031. At s\u2229q the labeled angle b = 122\u00b0 is not the acute angle between s and q but rather its supplement; so the acute angle is 58\u00b0.\n\u20032. At s\u2229r the labeled angle a = 43\u00b0 is the acute angle between s and r.\n\u20033. At r\u2229t, the \u201cbottom\u2013left\u201d angle is the one that is congruent (by alternate\u2013interior angle relationships) to the acute angle between s and q (namely 58\u00b0), so that the complete measure is 58\u00b0. Because that angle is bisected, we have \n\u2003\u20032w = 58\u00b0\u2003\u27f9\u2003w = 29\u00b0.\n\nThis interpretation is the one that makes all the relationships \u201cfit together nicely\u201d: \n\u2003\u2022 s meets q (and t) so that its acute deviation from the horizontal is 58\u00b0.\n\u2003\u2022 r then differs from s by 43\u00b0 (since a = 43\u00b0) so that r\u2019s acute angle with the horizontal is 58\u00b0 \u2013 43\u00b0 = 15\u00b0; but the \u201cangle\u201d used at the r\u2013t intersection is not this very small 15\u00b0 but rather its \u201calternate\u2013exterior\u201d supplement with respect to the parallel lines, namely 180\u00b0 \u2013 15\u00b0 = 165\u00b0.\n\u2003\u2022 However, the angle that the diagram \u201cmarks\u201d in the bottom\u2013left of the r\u2013t intersection happens to be the one corresponding to the acute 58\u00b0 (via the usual parallel\u2013line angle\u2013correspondence); so that the full angle there is 58\u00b0 and then each of its two equal parts is w = 58\u00b0/2 = 29\u00b0.\n\nThus, under these common conventions, we obtain w = 29\u00b0.\n\nAnswer: 29\u00b0.\n\nNote: In problems of this sort the answer depends on exactly which angles are labeled in the diagram. The \u201ctrick\u201d is to use the fact that when one transversal cuts parallel lines the \u201ccorresponding\u201d or \u201calternate interior\u201d angles (or their supplements) are equal. Here that fact \u201cbridges\u201d the figures at s\u2229q and r\u2229t so that 2w equals the acute angle (58\u00b0) that s makes with the parallel lines, yielding w = 29\u00b0.", "o3-mini (all_token_count)": 6836, "o3-mini (thinking_token_count)": 5120}

The value of $g(7 - w)$ is the value of $g(x)$ when $x = 7 - w$ , where $w$ is a constant. Substituting $7 - w$ for $x$ in the given equation yields $g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ , which is equivalent to $g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ . It's given that the value of $g(7 - w)$ is $0$ . Substituting $0$ for $g(7 - w)$ in the equation $g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ yields $0 = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ . Since the product of the three factors on the right-hand side of this equation is equal to $0$ , at least one of these three factors must be equal to $0$ . Therefore, the possible values of $w$ can be found by setting each factor equal to $0$ . Setting the first factor equal to $0$ yields $7 - w = 0$ . Adding $w$ to both sides of this equation yields $7 = w$ . Therefore, $7$ is one possible value of $w$ . Setting the second factor equal to $0$ yields $5 - w = 0$ . Adding $w$ to both sides of this equation yields $5 = w$ . Therefore, $5$ is a second possible value of $w$ . Setting the third factor equal to $0$ yields $(13 - w)^2 = 0$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $13 - w = 0$ . Adding $w$ to both sides of this equation yields $13 = w$ . Therefore, $13$ is a third possible value of $w$ . Adding the three possible values of $w$ yields $7 + 5 + 13$ , or $25$ .

It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $f(x)$ is the height of the object $x$ seconds after it was launched, and $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, $k$, when $x = h$. Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of $1,034$ feet above the ground $8$ seconds after being launched, $f(x)$ reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = 8$. Therefore, $k = 1,034$ and $h = 8$. Substituting $8$ for $h$ and $1,034$ for $k$ in the function $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of $10$ feet above the ground, the value of $f(x)$ is $10$ when $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$ yields $10 = a(0 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $10 = 64a + 1,034$. Subtracting $1,034$ from both sides of this equation yields $64a = -1,024$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = -16$. Therefore, the model can be represented by the equation $f(x) = -16(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Substituting $10$ for $x$ in this equation yields $f(10) = -16(10 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $f(10) = 970$.

It's given that the logo is in the shape of a trapezoid that consists of three congruent equilateral triangles, and that the perimeter of the trapezoid is 20 centimeters (cm). Since the perimeter of the trapezoid is the sum of the lengths of 5 of the sides of the triangles, the length of each side of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{20}{5}=4 \\text{ centimeters}$ . Dividing up one equilateral triangle into two right triangles yields a pair of congruent 30$^{\\circ}$-60$^{\\circ}$-90$^{\\circ}$ triangles. The shorter leg of each right triangle is half the length of the side of an equilateral triangle, or 2 cm.

Alternate approach: The area of a trapezoid can be found by evaluating the expression $\\frac{1}{2} (b_{1} + b_{2}) h$ , where $b_{1}$ is the length of one base, $b_{2}$ is the length of the other base, and h is the height of the trapezoid.

(A diagram of the figure is given in the problem statement.) One common way to do this is as follows.\n\nStep 1. Setting Up Coordinates and the Triangles\n\nAssume each equilateral triangle has side\u2010length s. We can \u201cbuild\u201d the trapezoid using these three triangles. For example, define the following points:\n\u2003\u2022 Let A = (0, 0) and B = (2s, 0). (Thus the entire bottom side of the trapezoid will be AB.)\n\u2003\u2022 The two adjacent lower equilateral triangles have bases of length s. One triangle uses the base from (0,0) to (s,0) and the other uses (s,0) to (2s,0).\n\u2003\u2022 The height of an equilateral triangle is (\u221a3/2)\u00b7s. So the apex of the left triangle is at D = (s/2, (\u221a3/2)s) and that of the right triangle is at E = (3s/2, (\u221a3/2)s).\n\u2003\u2022 Now, \u201ccap\u201d the configuration with a third equilateral triangle (with the same side\u2010length s) having base DE (which has length s) and apex at C = (s, (\u221a3/2)s + (\u221a3/2)s) = (s, \u221a3\u00b7s).\n\nThus, the vertices of the trapezoid are the \u201couter\u201d points:\n\u2003\u2022 Lower base: A = (0, 0) and B = (2s, 0)\n\u2003\u2022 Upper base: D = (s/2, (\u221a3/2)s) and E = (3s/2, (\u221a3/2)s)\n\n(Notice that the point C is \u201cinside\u201d the outline; it is the vertex of the top (central) equilateral triangle. In the logo the top triangle is unshaded and the two bottom triangles are shaded. Each shaded triangle shares the side along which it touches the top triangle.)\n\nStep 2. Determining the Perimeter\n\nThe trapezoid\u2019s sides are:\n\u2003\u2022 Bottom side AB from (0, 0) to (2s, 0): Length = 2s.\n\u2003\u2022 Top side DE from (s/2, (\u221a3/2)s) to (3s/2, (\u221a3/2)s): Length = (3s/2 \u2212 s/2) = s.\n\u2003\u2022 Left leg from A = (0, 0) to D = (s/2, (\u221a3/2)s): Its length is\n\u2003\u2003\u221a[(s/2 \u2212 0)\u00b2 + ((\u221a3/2)s \u2212 0)\u00b2] = \u221a[(s\u00b2/4) + (3s\u00b2/4)] = \u221a(s\u00b2) = s.\n\u2003\u2022 Right leg from B = (2s, 0) to E = (3s/2, (\u221a3/2)s): Also s.\n\nThus the total perimeter P of the trapezoid is:\n\u2003\u2003P = (2s) + s + s + s = 5s.\n\nWe are told that the perimeter is 20 centimeters, so we solve:\n\u2003\u20035s = 20\u2003\u27f9\u2003s = 4 cm.\n\nStep 3. Finding the Shaded Areas\n\nThe area of one equilateral triangle of side s is:\n\u2003\u2003Area = (\u221a3/4)\u00b7s\u00b2.\nWith s = 4, the area of one triangle is:\n\u2003\u2003(\u221a3/4)\u00b7(4\u00b2) = (\u221a3/4)\u00b716 = 4\u221a3.\n\nIn the logo, the two lower triangles are shaded. Therefore, the combined shaded area is:\n\u2003\u20032 \u00d7 (4\u221a3) = 8\u221a3 square centimeters.\n\nStep 4.

In the triangle shown, the measure of angle $B$ is $30 degree$ and angle $C$ is a right angle, which means that it has a measure of $90 degree$. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to $180 degree$, the measure of angle $A$ is equal to $180 degree - ( 30 + 90 ) degree$, or $60 degree$. In a right triangle whose acute angles have measures $30 degree$ and $60 degree$, the lengths of the legs can be represented by the expressions $x$, $x \\sqrt{3}$, and $2 x$, where $x$ is the length of the leg opposite the angle with measure $30 degree$, $x \\sqrt{3}$ is the length of the leg opposite the angle with measure $60 degree$, and $2 x$ is the length of the hypotenuse. In the triangle shown, the hypotenuse has a length of $54$. It follows that $2 x = 54$, or $x = 27$. Therefore, the length of the leg opposite angle $B$ is $27$ and the length of the leg opposite angle $A$ is $27 \\sqrt{3}$. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle.

It's given that each vertex of the rectangle lies on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let $s$ represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it's given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, $2s$ represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $s$ for $a$ and $2s$ for $c$ in this equation yields $s^2 + b^2 = (2s)^2$, or $s^2 + b^2 = 4s^2$. Subtracting $s^2$ from both sides of this equation yields $b^2 = 3s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $b = s \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the length, in units, of the rectangle's longest side is $s \\sqrt{3}$. The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the shortest side and the length of the longest side. The lengths, in units, of the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle are represented by $s$ and $s \\sqrt{3}$, and it's given that the area of the rectangle is $1089 \\sqrt{3}$ square units.

Since the graph passes through the point $(0, -6)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $0$, the value of $y$ is $-6$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $-6$ for $y$ in the given equation yields $-6=2(0)^2 + b(0)+c$, or $-6=c$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is $-6$. Substituting $-6$ for $c$ in the given equation yields $y=2x^2+bx-6$. Since the graph passes through the point $(-1,-8)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $-1$, the value of $y$ is $-8$.

Alternate approach: The given equation represents a parabola in the xy-plane with a vertex at $(-1,-8)$. Therefore, the given equation, $y=2x^2+bx+c$, which is written in standard form, can be written in vertex form, $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola and $a$ is the value of the coefficient on the $x^2$ term when the equation is written in standard form.

In addition, you\u2019re told that \u2220BCD = 60\u00b0 and that the side BC has length 12.\n\nStep 1. Analyze triangle BDC.\n\nTriangle BDC is right\u2010angled at D and has \u2220BCD = 60\u00b0. (That forces the third angle, \u2220CBD, to be 30\u00b0.) Thus, triangle BDC is a 30\u201360\u201390 right triangle. The ratios in such a triangle are\n\n\u2003\u2003side opposite 30\u00b0 : side opposite 60\u00b0 : hypotenuse = 1 : \u221a3 : 2.\n\nAssign x as the length of the side opposite 30\u00b0. In triangle BDC the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle is DC and the hypotenuse is BC.

Analyze triangle ABD.\n\nBecause D lies on AC and BD is perpendicular to AC, BD is the altitude from B to AC. Now consider triangle ABD. Its vertices are A, B, and D, and since BD \u22a5 AC, we know that \u2220BDA = 90\u00b0.\n\nYou are told that \u2220ABD = 30\u00b0. In triangle ABD the angles are\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2220B = 30\u00b0,\u2003\u2220D = 90\u00b0\u2003\u2192\u2003\u2220A = 60\u00b0.\n\nThus, triangle ABD is also a 30\u201360\u201390 right triangle. (Its sides will be in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2, with the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle being the shortest.)\n\nIn triangle ABD, the side opposite the 30\u00b0 angle (angle B) is AD, and the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is BD.
