Subtracting the same number from each side of an inequality gives an equivalent inequality. Hence, subtracting 1 from each side of the inequality $2x > 5$ gives $2x - 1 > 4$ . So the given system of inequalities is equivalent to the system of inequalities $y > 2x - 1$ and $2x - 1 > 4$ , which can be rewritten as $y > 2x - 1 > 4$ .

For example, $\\text{the point with coordinates } (3,5.5)$ satisfies both inequalities. Choice C is incorrect. This may result from solving the inequality $2x > 5$ for x , then replacing x with y .

The system of inequalities is:\n$$2x - y < 3$$\n$$x + y < 3$$\nTo determine the y-coordinates of all the points that satisfy the system of inequalities, we want to eliminate the variable $x$.\nWe can multiply the second inequality by 2 to obtain\n$$2(x + y) < 2(3)$$\n$$2x + 2y < 6$$\nNow we have the two inequalities\n$$2x - y < 3$$\n$$2x + 2y < 6$$\nWe can subtract the first inequality from the second inequality to eliminate $x$:\n$$(2x + 2y) - (2x - y) < 6 - 3$$\n$$2x + 2y - 2x + y < 3$$\n$$3y < 3$$\nDividing both sides by 3 gives\n$$y < 1$$\nHowever, this is not one of the options.

Thus $y < 1$.\n\nWe want to find the region where the two inequalities are satisfied. We can rewrite the first inequality as $y > 2x - 3$, and the second inequality as $y < 3 - x$.\nWe want to find the intersection of these two regions.\nWe can find the point of intersection by setting the two expressions for $y$ equal:\n$2x - 3 = 3 - x$\n$3x = 6$\n$x = 2$\nAt $x=2$, we have $y = 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$.\nSo the two lines intersect at $(2,1)$.\nThe region where both inequalities are satisfied is where $2x - 3 < y < 3 - x$.\nWe want to find the range of $y$ values.\nIf $x = 0$, we have $-3 < y < 3$.\nIf $x = 1$, we have $2(1) - 3 = -1 < y < 3 - 1 = 2$.\nIf $x = 2$, we have $2(2) - 3 = 1 < y < 3 - 2 = 1$. This means $y = 1$.\nIf $x = 3$, we have $2(3) - 3 = 3 < y < 3 - 3 = 0$, which is impossible.\n\nLet's rewrite the inequalities as $y > 2x - 3$ and $y < 3 - x$.\nWe want to find a lower bound for $y$. Since $y > 2x - 3$, we want to minimize $2x - 3$.\nWe have $y < 3 - x$, so $x < 3 - y$. Then $2x < 6 - 2y$.\nThus $2x - 3 < 6 - 2y - 3 = 3 - 2y$.\nSince $y > 2x - 3$, we have $y > 3 - 2y$.\nThus $3y > 3$, so $y > 1$.\nThe inequalities are $y > 2x - 3$ and $y < 3 - x$.\n\nIf we add the two inequalities, we get $3x < 6$, so $x < 2$.\nConsider $x = 2 - \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number. Then $2x - 3 = 2(2 - \\epsilon) - 3 = 4 - 2\\epsilon - 3 = 1 - 2\\epsilon$.\nAlso, $3 - x = 3 - (2 - \\epsilon) = 1 + \\epsilon$.\nThen we need $1 - 2\\epsilon < y < 1 + \\epsilon$.

We need $2x - 3 < y$, so $2x < y+3$.\nThus, $2x < \\min\\{6 - 2y, y+3\\}$.\n\nThe solution is $y > 1$. None of the options match this. However, if we express $x$ in terms of $y$ from $x+y<3$, then $x<3-y$. Substituting this into the first equation: $2(3-y)-y<3 \\Rightarrow 6-2y-y<3 \\Rightarrow 3 < 3y \\Rightarrow y > 1$. Since none of the given answer choices state $y>1$, let's examine an example.\n\nWe know that $y > 2x-3$ and $y < 3-x$. If $x=3/2$, then $y > 2(3/2) -3=0$ and $y < 3-(3/2) = 3/2$. So $0 < y < 3/2$. If $x=1$, then $2(1)-3 = -1 < y < 3-1=2$, so $-1<y<2$. If $y=3/2$, then $2x-(3/2) < 3 \\Rightarrow 2x<9/2 \\Rightarrow x<9/4$ and $x+(3/2) < 3 \\Rightarrow x<3/2$.\nSince $y > 1$, let's see which ones apply.\nConsider y=2. $2x-2<3 \\Rightarrow x < 5/2$ and $x<3-2=1$. So x<1. Then $2(0.5) -2 < 3 \\Rightarrow 1-2 <3$, which is true.\nHowever, $2 < 3 - 0.5$ which is also true. So y=2 is ok.\nNow, consider $x \\to -\\infty$. Since y has to be larger than $2x - 3$, this implies y approaches $-\\infty$ but is greater than that. So not necessarily.\nThen $y>2x-3$ implies y must increase with x.\nNone of the answers appear correct.\n\nConsider x = 0.  Then -y < 3 => y > -3 and y < 3.\nIf y > 3, then 2x - y < 3 => 2x < 3 + y and x+y < 3.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{y > \\frac{3}{2}}$"}

The given system of equations can be solved using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the second equation in the given system by $-2$ yields $-2ty = -1 -4x$, or $-1 -4x = -2ty$. Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system, $4x -6y = 10y + 2$, yields $(4x -6y) + (-1 -4x) = (10y +2) + (-2ty)$, or $-1 -6y = 10y -2ty +2$. Subtracting $10y$ from both sides of this equation yields $(-1 -6y) - (10y) = (10y -2ty +2) - (10y)$, or $-1 -16y = -2ty +2$. If the given system has no solution, then the equation $-1 -16y = -2ty +2$ has no solution. If this equation has no solution, the coefficients of $y$ on each side of the equation, $-16$ and $-2t$, must be equal, which yields the equation $-16 = -2t$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $-2$ yields $8 = t$. Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of $t$ is $8$. Alternate approach: A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the x-coefficients is equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the x-coefficients are not equal to the ratio of the constant terms. Subtracting $10y$ from both sides of the first equation in the given system yields $(4x -6y) - (10y) = (10y +2) - (10y)$, or $4x -16y =2$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides of the second equation in the given system yields $(ty) - (2x) = (\\frac{1}{2} +2x) - (2x)$, or $-2x + ty = \\frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the x-coefficients for these equations is $-\\frac{2}{4}$, or $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the y-coefficients for these equations is $-\\frac{t}{16}$. The ratio of the constant terms for these equations is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{2}$, or $\\frac{1}{4}$. Since the ratio of the x-coefficients, $-\\frac{1}{2}$, is not equal to the ratio of the constants, $\\frac{1}{4}$, the lines represented by the equations are distinct. Setting the ratio of the x-coefficients equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients yields $-\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{t}{16}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $-16$ yields $( -\\frac{1}{2} ) ( -16 ) = ( -\\frac{t}{16} ) ( -16 )$, or $t =8$.

Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses $200h$ calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses $150b$ calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It's given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ yields $200h + 150 \\times 2 = 1900$, or $200h + 300 = 1900$. Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields $200h = 1600$. Dividing both sides by 200 yields $h = 8$. Since h represents the number of 30-minute periods spent hiking and there are 2 30-minute periods in every hour, it follows that the adult will need to hike for $\\frac{8}{2}$, or 4 hours to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking.

Since $f(x)$ represents the company's profit, in dollars, for selling $x$ items, the graph of $y=f(x)$ in the xy -plane passes through the points $(8,220)$ and $(10,320)$. Substituting $(8,220)$ and $(10,320)$ for $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m=\\frac{320-220}{10-8}$, which gives $m=\\frac{100}{2}$, or $m=50$. Substituting $50$ for $m$, $8$ for $x$, and $220$ for $f(x)$ in $f(x)=mx+b$ yields $220=(50)(8)+b$, or $220=400+b$. Subtracting $400$ from each side of this equation yields $-180=b$. Substituting $50$ for $m$ and $-180$ for $b$ in $f(x)=mx+b$ yields $f(x)=50x-180$. Therefore, the equation that defines $f$ is $f(x)=50x-180$.

Let $s$ represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let $l$ represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It's given that the owner pays $4.90$ per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60$ per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays $4.90s$ dollars for $s$ small candles and $11.60 l$ dollars for $l$ large candles, which means the owner pays a total of $4.90s + 11.60 l$ dollars to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets $2,200$ to purchase candles. Therefore, $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$. It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of $200$ candles. Therefore, $s + l \\geq 200$. The inequalities $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$ and $s + l \\geq 200$ can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting $l$ from both sides of the inequality $s + l \\geq 200$ yields $s \\geq 200 - l$. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by $4.90$ yields $4.90s \\geq 4.90 (200 - l )$, or $4.90s \\geq 980 - 4.90 l$. Adding $11.60 l$ to both sides of this inequality yields $4.90s + 11.60 l \\geq 980 - 4.90 l + 11.60 l$, or $4.90s + 11.60 l \\geq 980 + 6.70 l$.

Since it's given that $x$ is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression $n(x-2)$ . Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for $x$ hours of repair is $f(x)=220+n(x-2)$ . It's given that the total cost for $5$ hours of repair is $\\$400$ . Substituting $5$ for $x$ and $400$ for $f(x)$ into the equation $f(x)=220+n(x-2)$ yields $400=220+3n$ . Subtracting $220$ from both sides of this equation yields $180=3n$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $3$ yields $n=60$ . Substituting $60$ for $n$ in the equation $f(x)=220+n(x-2)$ yields $f(x)=220+60(x-2)$ , which is equivalent to $f(x)=220+60x-120$ , or $f(x)=60x+100$ .

It's given that a linear model estimates the population of a city from $1991$ to $2015$ . Since the population can be estimated using a linear model, it follows that there is a constant rate of change for the model. It's also given that the model estimates the population was $57$ thousand in $1991$, $224$ thousand in $2011$, and $x$ thousand in $2015$ . The change in the population between $2011$ and $1991$ is $224 - 57$, or $167$ , thousand. The change in the number of years between $2011$ and $1991$ is $2011 - 1991$, or $20$ , years.

The change in the number of years between $2015$ and $2011$ is $2015 - 2011$ , or $4$ , years. Multiplying the change in population per year by the change in number of years yields the increase in population from $2011$ to $2015$ estimated by the model: $(8.35)(4)$ , or $33.4$ , thousand. Adding the change in population from $2011$ to $2015$ estimated by the model to the estimated population in $2011$ yields the estimated population in $2015$ .

Let the economist's model be the linear function $Q = mP + b$, where Q is the demand, P is the selling price, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line in the xy-plane, where $y = Q$. Two pairs of the selling price P and the demand Q are given. Using the coordinate pairs $(P, Q)$, two points that satisfy the function are $(40,20000)$ and $60,15000)$. The slope m of the function can be found using the formula $m = \\frac{Q_{2} - Q_{1}}{P_{2} - P_{1}}$. Substituting the given values into this formula yields $m = \\frac{15000 - 20000}{60 - 40}$, or $m = -250$. Therefore, $Q = -250P + b$. The value of b can be found by substituting one of the points into the function. Substituting the values of P and Q from the point $(40,20000)$ yields $20000 = -250 \\times 40 + b$, or $20000 = -10000 + b$. Adding 10000 to both sides of this equation yields $b = 30000$.

It's also given in the table that when $x=1$, $f(x)=32$. Substituting $1$ for $x$ and $32$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x)=mx+29$ yields $32=m(1)+29$, or $32=m+29$. Subtracting $29$ from both sides of this equation yields $3=m$. Substituting $3$ for $m$ in the equation $f(x)=mx+29$ yields $f(x)=3x+29$. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.", "gemini-2.0-flash (response)": "We are given that $f$ is a linear function, so we can write it as $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\nFrom the table, we see that when $x=0$, $f(0) = 29$. Since $f(0) = m(0) + b = b$, we have $b = 29$.\nNow we can write $f(x) = mx + 29$. We can use another point from the table to find the slope $m$. When $x=1$, $f(1) = 32$, so $f(1) = m(1) + 29 = 32$.\nSubtracting 29 from both sides, we get $m = 32 - 29 = 3$.\nSo, the equation for $f(x)$ is $f(x) = 3x + 29$.\n\nTo check our answer, we can use the point $x=2$.

Since the two angles form a straight line, they are supplementary, which means $x + 170^\\circ = 180^\\circ$. Thus, $x = 180^\\circ - 170^\\circ = 10^\\circ$.\nSince line $m$ is parallel to line $n$, the corresponding angles are congruent. The angle $x$ is an alternate interior angle to the angle labeled $w$. Thus, $w = x$.\nSo, $w = 10^\\circ$.\nHowever, we are not given $10^\\circ$ as a choice. Let's consider another possibility.\n\nThe angle adjacent to $w$ is $180^\\circ - w$.\nSince lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel, the corresponding angles are congruent. The angle $170^\\circ$ is an exterior angle of the angle $w$, and since lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel, we know that the corresponding angles are supplementary, so $w + 170^\\circ = 180^\\circ$, which means $w = 180^\\circ - 170^\\circ = 10^\\circ$. However, we are not given $10^\\circ$ as a choice.\n\nLet the angle at the intersection of line $m$ and line $t$ adjacent to the $170^\\circ$ angle be $x$. Since the sum of these angles on a straight line is $180^\\circ$, we have $x + 170^\\circ = 180^\\circ$, so $x = 10^\\circ$. Since line $m$ is parallel to line $n$, $x$ and $w$ are corresponding angles and are congruent, so $w = x = 10^\\circ$.\nHowever, $10^\\circ$ is not a choice.\n\nConsider the angles on line $n$. Let $v$ be the angle supplementary to $w$, so $v + w = 180^\\circ$.\nSince lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel, the angles $v$ and $170^\\circ$ are corresponding angles and are congruent, so $v = 170^\\circ$.\nThen $w = 180^\\circ - v = 180^\\circ - 170^\\circ = 10^\\circ$. Again, this is not an answer choice.\n\nLet's think about it differently. The interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary. Therefore, $170^\\circ$ and $w$ must sum to $180^\\circ$, since lines $m$ and $n$ are parallel. Thus, $170^\\circ + w = 180^\\circ$, which implies $w = 10^\\circ$.\n\nLet's consider the case where the $170^\\circ$ angle is on the top right. Then the angle on the top left is $180 - 170 = 10$. The angle on the bottom left is $w$. The lines are parallel, so the angles must be the same. Therefore, $w = 10$.\nHowever, the $170^\\circ$ angle is on the bottom left. So the angle on the bottom right is $180 - 170 = 10$. Then the top right angle is $w$, so $w = 170$.\n\nThe given angle of $170^\\circ$ is at the bottom left of the intersection of $m$ and $t$. The angle at the bottom left of the intersection of $n$ and $t$ is $w$. Since $m$ and $n$ are parallel, the angle at the top right of the intersection of $m$ and $t$ is $180-170=10$. Then the angle at the bottom left of the intersection of $n$ and $t$ is the corresponding angle. The supplementary angle to $w$ at the intersection of $n$ and $t$ is $170$. Therefore $w=180-170=10$.\n\nThe only given answer choice that corresponds to the top right angle being $170$ is the last one, $170$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{170}$"}

Functions $f$ and $g$ are both exponential functions with a base of $0.40$. Since $0.40$ is less than $1$, functions $f$ and $g$ are both decreasing exponential functions. This means that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ decrease as $x$ increases. Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ decrease as $x$ increases, the maximum value of each function occurs at the least value of $x$ for which the function is defined. It's given that functions $f$ and $g$ are defined for $x \\geq 0$. Therefore, the maximum value of each function occurs at $x=0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation defining $f$ yields $f(0)=33(0.4)^0+3$, which is equivalent to $f(0)=33(0.4)^3$, or $f(0)=2.112$. Therefore, the maximum value of $f$ is $2.112$. Since the equation $f(x)=33(0.4)^x+3$ doesn't display the value $2.112$, the equation defining $f$ doesn't display the maximum value of $f$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation defining $g$ yields $g(0)=33(0.16)(0.4)^0 - 2$, which can be rewritten as $g(0)=33(0.16)(\\frac{1}{0.4^{2}})$, or $g(0)=33(0.16)(\\frac{1}{0.16})$, which is equivalent to $g(0)=33$.

If $f(-9)=f(3)$, then for the graph of $y=f(x)$, the point with an x-coordinate of $-9$ and the point with an x-coordinate of $3$ have the same y-coordinate. In the xy-plane, a parabola is a symmetric graph such that when two points have the same y-coordinate, these points are equidistant from the vertex, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinates of these two points. Therefore, for the graph of $y=f(x)$, the points with x-coordinates $-9$ and $3$ are equidistant from the vertex, $(h, k)$, and $h$ is halfway between $-9$ and $3$. The value that is halfway between $-9$ and $3$ is $\\frac{-9 + 3}{2}$, or $-3$. Therefore, $h=-3$. The equation defining $f$ can also be written in vertex form, $f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k$.

It's given that segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$. Extending segment $BC$ at point $C$ and extending segment $DE$ at point $D$ until the two segments intersect results in a transversal that intersects two parallel line segments. One of these intersection points is point $B$, and let the other intersection point be point $X$. Since segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$, alternate interior angles are congruent. Angle $CXD$ and the exterior angle formed by extending segment $AB$ at point $B$ are alternate interior angles. Therefore, the measure of angle $CXD$ is $41$ degrees. It's given that the measure of angle $D$ in pentagon $ABCDE$ is $174$ degrees. Therefore, angle $CDX$ has measure $180 - 174$, or $6$, degrees.

The radius of a circle is half the diameter of the circle. Since the base of a right circular cylinder is a circle, it follows that the radius of the base of the right circular cylinder is $\\frac{22}{2}$ , or $11$ , centimeters. Therefore, $r=11$ .

The quadratic equation that models this situation can be written in the form $d = a t^{2} + b t + c$, where a, b, and c are constants.

Since it's also given that d is 50 when t is 10 and d is 200 when t is 20, these values for d and t can be substituted to create a system of two linear equations: $50 = a \\cdot 10^2 + b \\cdot 10$ and $200 = a \\cdot 20^2 + b \\cdot 20$, or $10a + b = 5$ and $20a + b = 10$.

It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ , where $f(x)$ is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, $x$ seconds after the launch, $a$ is a constant, and $k$ is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached $h$ seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Therefore, $k=51.1$ and $h=3$ . Substituting $51.1$ for $k$ and $3$ for $h$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground. Therefore, when $x=0$ , $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $7$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = a(0 - 3)^2 + 51.1$ , or $7 = 9a + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = 9a$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $9$ yields $-4.9 = a$ . Substituting $-4.9$ for $a$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Therefore, the equation $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground $x$ seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters is the value of $x$ when $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $7$ for $f(x)$ in $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = -4.9(x - 3)^2$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $-4.9$ yields $9 = (x - 3)^2$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: $3 = x - 3$ and $-3 = x - 3$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $3 = x - 3$ yields $6 = x$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $-3 = x - 3$ yields $0 = x$ . Since $0$ seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, $6$ must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took $3$ seconds to travel from $7$ meters above the ground to its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take $3$ more seconds to travel from its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground back to $7$ meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters $3$ seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is $6$ seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect.

Let $x$ be the first integer and let $y$ be the second integer. If the first integer is $11$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+11$. If the product of the two integers is $546$, then $xy=546$. Substituting $2y+11$ for $x$ in this equation results in $(2y+11)y=546$. Distributing the $y$ to both terms in the parentheses results in $2y^2 + 11y = 546$. Subtracting $546$ from both sides of this equation results in $2y^2 + 11y - 546 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2(-546)$, or $-1092$, and whose sum is $11$. The two values whose product is $-1092$ and whose sum is $11$ are $39$ and $-28$. Thus, the equation $2y^2 + 11y - 546 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2y^2 + 28y - 39y - 546 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2y(y-14) + 39(y-14) = 0$, or $(2y+39)(y-14) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2y+39=0$ and $y-14=0$. Subtracting $39$ from both sides of the equation $2y+39=0$ yields $2y=-39$.

Corresponding angles in similar triangles have equal measures. It's given that triangle $ABC$ is similar to triangle $DEF$, where $A$ corresponds to $D$, so the measure of angle $A$ is equal to the measure of angle $D$. Therefore, if $\\tan(A)=\\sqrt{3}$, then $\\tan(D)=\\sqrt{3}$. It's given that angles $C$ and $F$ are right angles, so triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are right triangles. The adjacent side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side closest to the angle that is not the hypotenuse. It follows that the adjacent side of angle $D$ is side $DF$. The opposite side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side across from the acute angle. It follows that the opposite side of angle $D$ is side $EF$. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. Therefore, $\\tan(D)=\\frac{EF}{DF}$. If $DF=125$, the length of side $EF$ can be found by substituting $\\sqrt{3}$ for $\\tan(D)$ and $125$ for $DF$ in the equation $\\tan(D)=\\frac{EF}{DF}$, which yields $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{EF}{125}$.

Clockwise from top, the circle passes through the following points: (-2, 3) (1, 0) (-2, -3) (-5, 0)", "Correct Answer": "A", "Rationale": "Choice A is correct. According to the graph, the center of circle A has coordinates $(-2, 0)$, and the radius of circle A is $3$. It's given that circle B is the result of shifting circle A down $6$ units and increasing the radius so that the radius of circle B is $2$ times the radius of circle A. It follows that the center of circle B is $6$ units below the center of circle A. The point that's $6$ units below $(-2, 0)$ has the same x-coordinate as $(-2, 0)$ and has a y-coordinate that is $6$ less than the y-coordinate of $(-2, 0)$. Therefore, the coordinates of the center of circle B are $(-2, 0-6)$, or $(-2, -6)$. Since the radius of circle B is $2$ times the radius of circle A, the radius of circle B is $(2)(3)$. A circle in the xy-plane can be defined by an equation of the form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where the coordinates of the center of the circle are $(h, k)$ and the radius of the circle is $r$. Substituting $-2$ for $h$, $-6$ for $k$, and $(2)(3)$ for $r$ in this equation yields $(x - (-2))^2 + (y - (-6))^2 = ((2)(3))^2$, which is equivalent to $(x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 = (2)^2(3)^2$, or $(x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 = (4)(9)$. Therefore, the equation $(x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 = (4)(9)$ defines circle B. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect. This equation defines a circle that's the result of shifting circle A up, not down, by $6$ units and increasing the radius. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.", "gemini-2.0-flash (response)": "Let the equation of circle A be $(x+2)^2 + y^2 = 9$. The center of circle A is $(-2, 0)$ and its radius is $\\sqrt{9} = 3$.\nCircle B is obtained by shifting circle A down 6 units and increasing the radius so that the radius of circle B is $2$ times the radius of circle A.\nSince circle A has a radius of 3, the radius of circle B is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nWhen shifting circle A down 6 units, the center of circle A, $(-2, 0)$, becomes $(-2, 0-6) = (-2, -6)$.\nSo, the center of circle B is $(-2, -6)$ and the radius of circle B is 6.\nThe equation of circle B is $(x - (-2))^2 + (y - (-6))^2 = 6^2$.\nThis simplifies to $(x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 36$.\nSince $36 = 4 \\times 9$, we can write the equation of circle B as $(x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 = 4(9)$.\nComparing this to the choices:\nA) $(x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 = (4)(9)$\nB) $2(x+2)^2 + 2(y+6)^2 = 9$\nC) $(x+2)^2 + (y-6)^2 = (4)(9)$\nD) $2(x+2)^2 + 2(y-6)^2 = 9$\nThe equation of circle B matches choice A.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 = (4)(9)}$"}

The figure shown includes two triangles, triangle $WQX$ and triangle $YQZ$, such that angle $WQX$ and angle $YQZ$ are vertical angles. It follows that angle $WQX$ is congruent to angle $YQZ$.

The equation has exactly one real solution.\nWhat is the minimum possible value of $4k$?", "Correct Answer": "231", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $231$. It's given that $\\sqrt{k - x} = 58 - x$. Squaring both sides of this equation yields $k - x = (58 - x)^2$, which is equivalent to the given equation if $58 - x > 0$. It follows that if a solution to the equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ satisfies $58 - x > 0$, then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ can be rewritten as $k - x = 3,364 - 116x + x^2$. Adding $x$ to both sides of this equation yields $k = x^2 - 115x + 3,364$. Subtracting $k$ from both sides of this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$. The number of solutions to a quadratic equation in the form $0 = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, can be determined by the value of the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$. Substituting $-115$ for $b$, $1$ for $a$, and $3,364 - k$ for $c$ in $b^2 - 4ac$ yields $(-115)^2 - 4(1)(3,364 - k)$, or $4k - 231$. The equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution if the discriminant is equal to zero, or $4k - 231 = 0$. Subtracting $231$ from both sides of this equation yields $4k = 231$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $k = 57.75$. Therefore, if $k = 57.75$, then the equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution. Substituting $57.75$ for $k$ in this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + 3,306.25$, which is equivalent to $0 = (x - 57.5)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $0 = x - 57.5$. Adding $57.5$ to both sides of this equation yields $57.5 = x$. To check whether this solution satisfies $58 - x > 0$, the solution, $57.5$, can be substituted for $x$ in $58 - x > 0$, which yields $58 - 57.5 > 0$, or $0.5 > 0$. Since $0.5 > 0$, it follows that if $k = 57.75$, or $4k = 231$, then the given equation has exactly one real solution.

Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double $\\frac{x}{2}$ \\times.

Substituting $2$ for $r$, $-24$ for $s$, and $-a + 64$ for $t$ in the expression $s^2 - 4 r t$ yields $( -24 )^2 - (4) (2) (64 - a)$. Setting this expression equal to zero yields $( -24 )^2 - (4) (2) (64 - a) = 0$, or $8a + 64 = 0$. Subtracting $64$ from both sides of this equation yields $8a = -64$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $8$ yields $a = -8$. Substituting $-8$ for $a$ in the equation $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 - a$ yields $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 + 8$, or $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 72$. Factoring $2$ from the right-hand side of this equation yields $0 = 2 ( x^2 - 12x + 36 )$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $0 = x^2 - 12x + 36$, which is equivalent to $0 = ( x - 6 ) ( x - 6 )$, or $0 = ( x - 6 )^2$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $0 = x - 6$. Adding $6$ to both sides of this equation yields $x = 6$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of $a$, not $x$.

In this equation, $b$ represents the time, in seconds, at which the softball reaches its maximum height of $c$ meters above the ground. It's given that this softball reaches a maximum height of $51.84$ meters above the ground at $1.8$ seconds; therefore, $b = 1.8$ and $c = 51.84$.

It's given that the radius of the circle is $168$ millimeters. Since points $M$ and $N$ both lie on the circle, segments $GM$ and $GN$ are both radii. Therefore, segments $GM$ and $GN$ each have length $168$ millimeters. Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment $MH$ and segment $NH$ have equal length. Let $x$ represent the length of segment $MH$. Then $x$ also represents the length of segment $NH$. It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral $GMHN$ is $3856$ millimeters. Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, $3856 = 168 + 168 + x + x$, or $3856 = 336 + 2x$. Subtracting $336$ from both sides of this equation yields $3520 = 2x$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $1760 = x$. Therefore, the length of segment $MH$ is $1760$ millimeters. A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment $GM$ is perpendicular to segment $MH$. Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle $GMH$ is a right angle.

It's given that angle $J$ is the right angle in triangle $\\triangle JKL$ . Therefore, the acute angles of triangle $\\triangle JKL$ are angle $K$ and angle $L$ . The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite its right angle. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle $\\triangle JKL$ is side $\\overline{KL}$ . The cosine of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. It's given that $\\cos(K)=\\frac{24}{51}$ . This can be written as $\\cos(K)=\\frac{8}{17}$ . Since the cosine of angle $K$ is a ratio, it follows that the length of the side adjacent to angle $K$ is $8n$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $17n$ , where $n$ is a constant. Therefore, $\\overline{JK}=8n$ and $\\overline{KL}=17n$ .

It's given that $f(x)=(x-10)(x+13)$, which can be rewritten as $f(x)=x^2 + 3x - 130$.

The x-coordinate of the vertex is the value of $x$ such that $f(x)$ reaches its minimum. For an equation in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\\frac{b}{2a}$.

The x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph of $y=g(x)$ in the xy-plane can be found by solving the equation $0=x(x+5)(x+4)$. Applying the zero product property to this equation yields three equations: $x=0$, $x+5=0$, and $x+4=0$. Solving each of these equations for $x$ yields $x=0$, $x=-5$, and $x=-4$, respectively. Therefore, the x-intercepts of the graph of $y=g(x)$ are $(0,0)$, $(-5,0)$, and $(-4,0)$. It follows that the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ are $0$, $-5$, and $-4$. Thus, the value of $a+b+c$ is $0 + (-5) + (-4)$, which is equal to $-9$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of $a+b+c$ if $g(x)=f(x+1)$. Choice C is incorrect. This is the value of $a+b+c-1$ if $g(x)=(x-6)(x-5)(x-1)$. Choice D is incorrect.

Substituting $23$ for $h$ and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k + 4$ yields $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 4 + 4$, or $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 8$. The value of $a$ can be found by substituting any x -value and its corresponding y -value for $x$ and $y$, respectively, in this equation. Substituting $25$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in this equation yields $-8 = (25 - 23)^2 + 8$, or $-8 = (2)^2 + 8$. Subtracting $8$ from both sides of this equation yields $-16 = (2)^2 a$, or $-16 = 4a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $-4 = a$. Substituting $-4$ for $a$, $23$ for $h$, and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = -4(x - 23)^2 + 4$. The y -intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the xy -plane is the point on the graph where $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = -4(x - 23)^2 + 4$ yields $f(0) = -4(0 - 23)^2 + 4$, or $f(0) = -4(-23)^2 + 4$. This is equivalent to $f(0) = -2112$, so the y -intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the xy -plane is $(0, -2112)$.

It's given that $f(x)=(x-14)(x+19)$, which can be rewritten as $f(x)=x^2 + 5x -266$.

The x-coordinate of the vertex is the value of $x$ such that $f(x)$ reaches its minimum.

Let $x$ represent the first integer and $y$ represent the second integer. If the first integer is $5$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+5$. It's given that the product of the two integers is $462$ ; therefore $xy=462$. Substituting $2y+5$ for $x$ in this equation yields $(2y+5)(y)=462$, which can be written as $2y^2 + 5y = 462$. Subtracting $462$ from each side of this equation yields $2y^2 + 5y - 462 = 0$.

The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, $m=\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 -x_1}$.

Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point $(1,3)$, the approximate value of $b$ can be found by substituting $1$ for $x$ and $3$ for $y$ in the equation $y=0.875x+b$, which yields $3=(0.875)(1)+b$, or $3=0.875+b$.

One way to find the radius of the circle is to rewrite the given equation in standard form, $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$ , where $h,k$ is the center of the circle and the radius of the circle is r. To do this, divide the original equation, $2x^{2}-6x+2y^{2}+2y=45$ , by 2 to make the leading coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ each equal to 1: $x^{2}-3x+y^{2}+y=22.5$ . Then complete the square to put the equation in standard form. To do so, first rewrite $x^{2}-3x+y^{2}+y=22.5$ as $(x^{2}-3x+2.25) -2.25 + (y^{2}+y+0.25) -0.25=22.5$ . Second, add 2.25 and 0.25 to both sides of the equation: $(x^{2}-3x+2.25)+(y^{2}+y+0.25)=25$ . Since $x^{2}-3x+2.25=(x-1.5)^{2}$ , $y^{2}+y+0.25=(y+0.5)^{2}$ , and $25=5^{2}$ , it follows that $(x-1.5)^{2}+(y+0.5)^{2}=5^{2}$ . Therefore, the radius of the circle is 5.

Dividing each side of this equation by $2$ yields $x^2 = \\frac{58^2}{2}$ , or $x^2 = \\frac{2 \\cdot 58^2}{4}$ . Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields two solutions: $x = \\frac{58 \\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $x = -\\frac{58 \\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . The value of $x$ must be positive because it represents a side length. Therefore, $x = \\frac{58 \\sqrt{2}}{2}$ , or $x = 29 \\sqrt{2}$ . The perimeter, in inches, of the triangle is $58 + x + x$ , or $58 + 2x$ . Substituting $29 \\sqrt{2}$ for $x$ in this expression gives a perimeter, in inches, of $58 + 2 (29 \\sqrt{2})$ , or $58 + 58 \\sqrt{2}$ . Choice A is incorrect.

It's given that the area of the original poster is $360$ square inches. Let $\\ell$ represent the length, in inches, of the original poster, and let $w$ represent the width, in inches, of the original poster.

It's also given that a copy of the poster is made in which the length and width of the original poster are each increased by $20\\%$.

This width can be rewritten as $w + 0.2 w$ inches, or $1.2 w$ inches. Since the area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width, it follows that the area, in square inches, of the copy is equal to $(1.2 \\ell)(1.2 w)$, which can be rewritten as $(1.2)(1.2)(\\ell w)$.

It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $f(x)$ is the height of the object $x$ seconds after it was launched, and $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, $k$, when $x = h$. Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of $1,034$ feet above the ground $8$ seconds after being launched, $f(x)$ reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = 8$. Therefore, $k = 1,034$ and $h = 8$. Substituting $8$ for $h$ and $1,034$ for $k$ in the function $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of $10$ feet above the ground, the value of $f(x)$ is $10$ when $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$ yields $10 = a(0 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $10 = 64a + 1,034$. Subtracting $1,034$ from both sides of this equation yields $64a = -1,024$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = -16$. Therefore, the model can be represented by the equation $f(x) = -16(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Substituting $10$ for $x$ in this equation yields $f(10) = -16(10 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $f(10) = 970$. Therefore, based on the model, $10$ seconds after being launched, the height of the object above the ground is $970$ feet. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

It's given that the logo is in the shape of a trapezoid that consists of three congruent equilateral triangles, and that the perimeter of the trapezoid is 20 centimeters (cm).

It's given that each vertex of the rectangle lies on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let $s$ represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it's given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, $2s$ represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $s$ for $a$ and $2s$ for $c$ in this equation yields $s^2 + b^2 = (2s)^2$, or $s^2 + b^2 = 4s^2$. Subtracting $s^2$ from both sides of this equation yields $b^2 = 3s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $b = s \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the length, in units, of the rectangle's longest side is $s \\sqrt{3}$. The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the shortest side and the length of the longest side. The lengths, in units, of the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle are represented by $s$ and $s \\sqrt{3}$, and it's given that the area of the rectangle is $1089 \\sqrt{3}$ square units. It follows that $1089 \\sqrt{3} = s ( s \\sqrt{3} \\right )$, or $1089 \\sqrt{3} = s^2 \\sqrt{3}$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $\\sqrt{3}$ yields $1089 = s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $33 = s$. Since the length, in units, of the diagonal is represented by $2s$, it follows that the length, in units, of the diagonal is $2 (33)$, or $66$.

Since the graph passes through the point $(0, -6)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $0$, the value of $y$ is $-6$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $-6$ for $y$ in the given equation yields $-6=2(0)^2 + b(0)+c$, or $-6=c$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is $-6$. Substituting $-6$ for $c$ in the given equation yields $y=2x^2+bx-6$. Since the graph passes through the point $(-1,-8)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $-1$, the value of $y$ is $-8$.

Therefore, these two angles are supplementary, so the sum of their measures is $180\\circ$ . It follows that $x + 133 = 180$ . Subtracting $133$ from both sides of this equation yields $x = 47$ .", "gemini-2.0-flash (response)": "Let the angle $x$ be the angle between lines $j$ and $t$ as shown in the figure.\nLet the other angle between lines $j$ and $t$ be $133^{\\circ}$.\nSince $j$ and $t$ intersect, the sum of the angles $x$ and $133^{\\circ}$ is $180^{\\circ}$.\nSo we have $x + 133^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$.\nTherefore, $x = 180^{\\circ} - 133^{\\circ} = 47^{\\circ}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the angle $133^{\\circ}$ is at the bottom right.\nSince $j$ and $k$ are parallel, the corresponding angles formed by line $t$ intersecting lines $j$ and $k$ are equal.\nTherefore, the angle on line $k$ that corresponds to the angle $133^{\\circ}$ on line $j$ is also $133^{\\circ}$.\nSince $x$ is supplementary to $133^{\\circ}$, we have $x + 133^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$, so $x = 180^{\\circ} - 133^{\\circ} = 47^{\\circ}$.\n\nIf the angle $133^{\\circ}$ is vertically opposite to $x$, then $x=133^{\\circ}$.\nHowever, since lines $j$ and $k$ are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal. The supplementary angles are $180^{\\circ} - x = 180^{\\circ} - 133^{\\circ} = 47^{\\circ}$.\nThe alternate interior angles are equal.\n\nIn this case, the angle $x$ is supplementary to $133^{\\circ}$, so $x + 133^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$.\nTherefore, $x = 180^{\\circ} - 133^{\\circ} = 47^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{47}$"}

For the graph shown, $x$ represents time, in seconds, and $y$ represents momentum, in newton-seconds. Therefore, the average rate of change, in newton-seconds per second, in the momentum of the object between two x -values is the difference in the corresponding y -values divided by the difference in the x -values. The graph shows that at $x = 2$, the corresponding y -value is $6$. The graph also shows that at $x = 6$, the corresponding y -value is $8$.
