{"Question ID": "f75bd744", "Instruction": "$4x -6y = 10y + 2$ $ty = \\frac{1}{2} + 2x$ In the given system of equations, $t$ is a constant.\nIf the system has no solution, what is the value of $t$?", "Correct Answer": "8", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $8$. The given system of equations can be solved using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the second equation in the given system by $-2$ yields $-2ty = -1 -4x$, or $-1 -4x = -2ty$. Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system, $4x -6y = 10y + 2$, yields $(4x -6y) + (-1 -4x) = (10y +2) + (-2ty)$, or $-1 -6y = 10y -2ty +2$. Subtracting $10y$ from both sides of this equation yields $(-1 -6y) - (10y) = (10y -2ty +2) - (10y)$, or $-1 -16y = -2ty +2$. If the given system has no solution, then the equation $-1 -16y = -2ty +2$ has no solution. If this equation has no solution, the coefficients of $y$ on each side of the equation, $-16$ and $-2t$, must be equal, which yields the equation $-16 = -2t$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $-2$ yields $8 = t$. Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of $t$ is $8$. Alternate approach: A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the x-coefficients is equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the x-coefficients are not equal to the ratio of the constant terms. Subtracting $10y$ from both sides of the first equation in the given system yields $(4x -6y) - (10y) = (10y +2) - (10y)$, or $4x -16y =2$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides of the second equation in the given system yields $(ty) - (2x) = (\\frac{1}{2} +2x) - (2x)$, or $-2x + ty = \\frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the x-coefficients for these equations is $-\\frac{2}{4}$, or $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the y-coefficients for these equations is $-\\frac{t}{16}$. The ratio of the constant terms for these equations is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{2}$, or $\\frac{1}{4}$. Since the ratio of the x-coefficients, $-\\frac{1}{2}$, is not equal to the ratio of the constants, $\\frac{1}{4}$, the lines represented by the equations are distinct. Setting the ratio of the x-coefficients equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients yields $-\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{t}{16}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $-16$ yields $( -\\frac{1}{2} ) ( -16 ) = ( -\\frac{t}{16} ) ( -16 )$, or $t =8$.

Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses $200h$ calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses $150b$ calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It's given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ yields $200h + 150 \\times 2 = 1900$, or $200h + 300 = 1900$. Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields $200h = 1600$.

Substituting $50$ for $m$, $8$ for $x$, and $220$ for $f(x)$ in $f(x)=mx+b$ yields $220=(50)(8)+b$, or $220=400+b$. Subtracting $400$ from each side of this equation yields $-180=b$. Substituting $50$ for $m$ and $-180$ for $b$ in $f(x)=mx+b$ yields $f(x)=50x-180$. Therefore, the equation that defines $f$ is $f(x)=50x-180$.

Since y represents the number of tons of cargo remaining to be moved x hours after the team started working, it follows that the x-intercept refers to the team having no cargo remaining to be moved after 4.8 hours.

Thus, $68x$ represents the amount earned, in dollars, from consulting for $x$ hours, and $85y$ represents the amount earned, in dollars, from drawing up plans for $y$ hours.

It's given that a linear model estimates the population of a city from $1991$ to $2015$ . Since the population can be estimated using a linear model, it follows that there is a constant rate of change for the model. It's also given that the model estimates the population was $57$ thousand in $1991$, $224$ thousand in $2011$, and $x$ thousand in $2015$ . The change in the population between $2011$ and $1991$ is $224 - 57$, or $167$ , thousand. The change in the number of years between $2011$ and $1991$ is $2011 - 1991$, or $20$ , years. Dividing $167$ by $20$ gives $\\frac{167}{20}$ , or $8.35$ , thousand per year. Thus, the change in population per year from $1991$ to $2015$ estimated by the model is $8.35$ thousand. The change in the number of years between $2015$ and $2011$ is $2015 - 2011$ , or $4$ , years. Multiplying the change in population per year by the change in number of years yields the increase in population from $2011$ to $2015$ estimated by the model: $(8.35)(4)$ , or $33.4$ , thousand. Adding the change in population from $2011$ to $2015$ estimated by the model to the estimated population in $2011$ yields the estimated population in $2015$ . Thus, the estimated population in $2015$ is $33.4 + 224$ , or $257.4$ , thousand. Therefore to the nearest whole number, the value of $x$ is $257$ .", "gpt-4o (response)": "To determine the value of \\( x \\), the estimated population in 2015, we need to first determine the rate of change in the population per year using the given points for 1991 and 2011. \n\nFirst, the population in 1991 was 57 thousand, and in 2011 it was 224 thousand. The time between 1991 and 2011 is 20 years. Using these two data points, we can calculate the annual increase in population (the slope of the line):\n\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\text{Population in 2011} - \\text{Population in 1991}}{\\text{Year 2011} - \\text{Year 1991}} = \\frac{224 - 57}{2011 - 1991} = \\frac{167}{20} = 8.35 \\text{ thousand people per year.}\n\\]\n\nNext, we use this slope to predict the population in 2015, knowing that 2015 is 4 years after 2011. If the population in 2011 is 224 thousand, the population in 2015 can be estimated by multiplying the annual increase by the number of years following 2011 and adding this to the population in 2011:\n\n\\[\nx = 224 + 8.35 \\times (2015 - 2011)\n\\]\n\nCalculate the value:\n\n\\[\nx = 224 + 8.35 \\times 4 = 224 + 33.4 = 257.4\n\\]\n\nRounding 257.4 to the nearest whole number gives us 257.

The graph of the equation $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ in the xy -plane is a circle with center $(h,k)$ and a radius of length $r$. The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the xy -plane intersects the y -axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the y -axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius.

Substituting $-3$ for $h$ in this equation yields $f(x)=a(x-(-3))^{2}+k$, or $f(x)=a(x+3)^{2}+k$. This equation is equivalent to $f(x)=a(x^{2}+6x+9)+k$, or $f(x)=a x^{2}+6a x+9a+k$. Since $f(x)=a x^{2}+4x+c$, it follows that $6a=4$ and $9a+k=c$. Dividing both sides of the equation $6a=4$ by $6$ yields $a=\\frac{4}{6}$, or $a=\\frac{2}{3}$. Since $\\frac{2}{3}<1$, it's not true that $a \\geq 1$. Therefore, statement II isn't true. Substituting $\\frac{2}{3}$ for $a$ in the equation $9a+k=c$ yields $9 ( \\frac{2}{3} )+k=c$, or $6+k=c$. Subtracting $6$ from both sides of this equation yields $k=c-6$. If $k<0$, then $c-6<0$, or $c<6$. Since $c$ could be any value less than $6$, it's not necessarily true that $c<0$. Therefore, statement I isn't necessarily true. Thus, neither I nor II must be true. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

It's given that the measure of angle $B$ is $139$ degrees. Therefore, the exterior angle formed by extending segment $AB$ at point $B$ has measure $180 - 139$, or $41$, degrees. It's given that segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$. Extending segment $BC$ at point $C$ and extending segment $DE$ at point $D$ until the two segments intersect results in a transversal that intersects two parallel line segments. One of these intersection points is point $B$, and let the other intersection point be point $X$. Since segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$, alternate interior angles are congruent. Angle $CXD$ and the exterior angle formed by extending segment $AB$ at point $B$ are alternate interior angles. Therefore, the measure of angle $CXD$ is $41$ degrees. It's given that the measure of angle $D$ in pentagon $ABCDE$ is $174$ degrees. Therefore, angle $CDX$ has measure $180 - 174$, or $6$, degrees. Since angle $C$ in pentagon $ABCDE$ is an exterior angle of triangle $CDX$, it follows that the measure of angle $C$ is the sum of the measures of angles $CDX$ and $CXD$.

It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ , where $f(x)$ is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, $x$ seconds after the launch, $a$ is a constant, and $k$ is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached $h$ seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Therefore, $k=51.1$ and $h=3$ . Substituting $51.1$ for $k$ and $3$ for $h$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground. Therefore, when $x=0$ , $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $7$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = a(0 - 3)^2 + 51.1$ , or $7 = 9a + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = 9a$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $9$ yields $-4.9 = a$ . Substituting $-4.9$ for $a$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Therefore, the equation $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground $x$ seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters is the value of $x$ when $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $7$ for $f(x)$ in $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = -4.9(x - 3)^2$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $-4.9$ yields $9 = (x - 3)^2$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: $3 = x - 3$ and $-3 = x - 3$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $3 = x - 3$ yields $6 = x$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $-3 = x - 3$ yields $0 = x$ . Since $0$ seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, $6$ must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took $3$ seconds to travel from $7$ meters above the ground to its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take $3$ more seconds to travel from its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground back to $7$ meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters $3$ seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is $6$ seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect. The model estimates that $3$ seconds after the launch, the projectile reached a height of $51.1$ meters, not $7$ meters. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Let $x$ be the first integer and let $y$ be the second integer. If the first integer is $11$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+11$. If the product of the two integers is $546$, then $xy=546$. Substituting $2y+11$ for $x$ in this equation results in $(2y+11)y=546$. Distributing the $y$ to both terms in the parentheses results in $2y^2 + 11y = 546$. Subtracting $546$ from both sides of this equation results in $2y^2 + 11y - 546 = 0$.

In triangle $RST$ , the two legs are $\\overline{RT}$ and $\\overline{ST}$ . Therefore, if the length of $\\overline{RT}$ is $72$ and the area of triangle $RST$ is $792$ , then $792 = \\frac{1}{2} (72) \\overline{ST}$ , or $792 = (36) \\overline{ST}$ .

Since $14=ah^{2}+k$, substituting $14$ for $ah^{2}+k$ into the equation $15=a+ah^{2}+k$ gives $15=a+14$. Subtracting $14$ from both sides of this equation gives $a=1$. Substituting $1$ for $a$ in the equations $14=ah^{2}+k$ and $20=ah^{2}-2ah+a+k$ gives $14=h^{2}+k$ and $20=1-2h+h^{2}+k$, respectively. Since $14=h^{2}+k$, substituting $14$ for $h^{2}+k$ in the equation $20=1-2h+h^{2}+k$ gives $20=1-2h+14$, or $20=15-2h$. Subtracting $15$ from both sides of this equation gives $5=-2h$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $-2$ gives $-\\frac{5}{2}=h$. Substituting $-\\frac{5}{2}$ for $h$ into the equation $14=h^{2}+k$ gives $14=( -\\frac{5}{2} )^{2}+k$, or $14=\\frac{25}{4}+k$.

The equation has exactly one real solution.\nWhat is the minimum possible value of $4k$?", "Correct Answer": "231", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $231$. It's given that $\\sqrt{k - x} = 58 - x$. Squaring both sides of this equation yields $k - x = (58 - x)^2$, which is equivalent to the given equation if $58 - x > 0$. It follows that if a solution to the equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ satisfies $58 - x > 0$, then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ can be rewritten as $k - x = 3,364 - 116x + x^2$. Adding $x$ to both sides of this equation yields $k = x^2 - 115x + 3,364$. Subtracting $k$ from both sides of this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$. The number of solutions to a quadratic equation in the form $0 = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, can be determined by the value of the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$. Substituting $-115$ for $b$, $1$ for $a$, and $3,364 - k$ for $c$ in $b^2 - 4ac$ yields $(-115)^2 - 4(1)(3,364 - k)$, or $4k - 231$. The equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution if the discriminant is equal to zero, or $4k - 231 = 0$. Subtracting $231$ from both sides of this equation yields $4k = 231$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $k = 57.75$. Therefore, if $k = 57.75$, then the equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution. Substituting $57.75$ for $k$ in this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + 3,306.25$, which is equivalent to $0 = (x - 57.5)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $0 = x - 57.5$. Adding $57.5$ to both sides of this equation yields $57.5 = x$. To check whether this solution satisfies $58 - x > 0$, the solution, $57.5$, can be substituted for $x$ in $58 - x > 0$, which yields $58 - 57.5 > 0$, or $0.5 > 0$. Since $0.5 > 0$, it follows that if $k = 57.75$, or $4k = 231$, then the given equation has exactly one real solution.

Let x be the number of years after 1985. It follows that $\\frac{x}{2}$ represents the number of 2-year periods that will occur within an x-year period. According to Moore's law, every 2 years, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to double. Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double $\\frac{x}{2}$ \\times. Since the number of transistors included on a microprocessor was 275,000, or .275 million, in 1985, the estimated number of transistors, in millions, included x years after 1985 can be modeled as $0.275 \\times 2^{x/2}$. The year in which the number of transistors is estimated to be 1.1 million is represented by the value of x when $1.1 = 0.275 \\times 2^{x/2}$. Dividing both sides of this equation by .275 yields $4 = 2^{x/2}$, which can be rewritten as $2^{2} = 2^{x/2}$. Since the exponential equation has equal bases on each side, it follows that the exponents must also be equal: $2 = \\frac{x}{2}$.

In this equation, $b$ represents the time, in seconds, at which the softball reaches its maximum height of $c$ meters above the ground. It's given that this softball reaches a maximum height of $51.84$ meters above the ground at $1.8$ seconds; therefore, $b = 1.8$ and $c = 51.84$. Substituting $1.8$ for $b$ and $51.84$ for $c$ in the equation $h = -a (t - b)^2 + c$ yields $h = -a (t - 1.8)^2 + 51.84$. It's also given that this softball hits the ground at $3.6$ seconds; therefore, $h = 0$ when $t = 3.6$. Substituting $0$ for $h$ and $3.6$ for $t$ in the equation $h = -a (t - 1.8)^2 + 51.84$ yields $0 = -a (3.6 - 1.8)^2 + 51.84$, which is equivalent to $0 = -3.24 a + 51.84$.

It's given that the radius of the circle is $168$ millimeters. Since points $M$ and $N$ both lie on the circle, segments $GM$ and $GN$ are both radii. Therefore, segments $GM$ and $GN$ each have length $168$ millimeters. Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment $MH$ and segment $NH$ have equal length. Let $x$ represent the length of segment $MH$. Then $x$ also represents the length of segment $NH$. It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral $GMHN$ is $3856$ millimeters. Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, $3856 = 168 + 168 + x + x$, or $3856 = 336 + 2x$. Subtracting $336$ from both sides of this equation yields $3520 = 2x$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $1760 = x$. Therefore, the length of segment $MH$ is $1760$ millimeters. A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment $GM$ is perpendicular to segment $MH$. Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle $GMH$ is a right angle. Therefore, triangle $GMH$ is a right triangle with legs of length $1760$ millimeters and $168$ millimeters, and hypotenuse $GH$. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $1760$ for $a$ and $168$ for $b$ in this equation yields $1760^2 + 168^2 = c^2$, or $3125824 = c^2$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $\\pm 1768 = c$. Since $c$ represents a length, which must be positive, the value of $c$ is $1768$.

It's given that angle $J$ is the right angle in triangle $\\triangle JKL$ . Therefore, the acute angles of triangle $\\triangle JKL$ are angle $K$ and angle $L$ . The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite its right angle. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle $\\triangle JKL$ is side $\\overline{KL}$ . The cosine of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. It's given that $\\cos(K)=\\frac{24}{51}$ .

It's given that $f$ is a quadratic function. It follows that $f$ can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants. It's also given that the table shows three values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$, where $y = f(x) + 4$. Substituting $a(x - h)^2 + k$ for $f(x)$ in this equation yields $y = a(x - h)^2 + k + 4$. This equation represents a quadratic relationship between $x$ and $y$, where $k + 4$ is either the maximum or the minimum value of $y$, which occurs when $x = h$. For quadratic relationships between $x$ and $y$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at the value of $x$ halfway between any two values of $x$ that have the same corresponding value of $y$. The table shows that x -values of $21$ and $25$ correspond to the same y -value, $-8$. Since $23$ is halfway between $21$ and $25$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at an x -value of $23$. The table shows that when $x = 23$, $y = 8$. It follows that $h = 23$ and $k + 4 = 8$. Subtracting $4$ from both sides of the equation $k + 4 = 8$ yields $k = 4$. Substituting $23$ for $h$ and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k + 4$ yields $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 4 + 4$, or $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 8$. The value of $a$ can be found by substituting any x -value and its corresponding y -value for $x$ and $y$, respectively, in this equation. Substituting $25$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in this equation yields $-8 = (25 - 23)^2 + 8$, or $-8 = (2)^2 + 8$. Subtracting $8$ from both sides of this equation yields $-16 = (2)^2 a$, or $-16 = 4a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $-4 = a$. Substituting $-4$ for $a$, $23$ for $h$, and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = -4(x - 23)^2 + 4$.

It's given that the dot plot represents a data set of the number of bursts for $13$ eruptions of a steam vent. The median of a data set with an odd number of elements is the middle element when the elements are in numerical order. For $13$ elements in numerical order, this is the $7th$ element. For this data set, the first $4$ elements have a value of $1$, and the next $5$ elements have a value of $2$. Thus, the $7th$ element in the ordered data set is $2$ and the median number of bursts for the original data set is $2$. If an additional eruption with $11$ bursts is added to this data set to create a new data set of $14$ eruptions, the median of the new data set will be between the $7th$ and $8th$ elements in the ordered set, which will also be $2$. Therefore, the median number of bursts for the new data set will be the same as the median number of bursts for the original data set. The mean number of bursts for the original data set is found by adding the values of all $13$ elements and dividing that sum by the number of elements, $13$. Since the data is shown in a dot plot, the sum of the values of the elements can be found by multiplying each element's value by its frequency: $1(4) + 2(5) + 3(2) + 4(1) + 5(1)$, or $29$. Therefore, the mean number of bursts for the original data set is $\\frac{29}{13}$. If an additional eruption with $11$ bursts is added to this data set to create a new data set of $14$ bursts, the mean number of bursts for the new data set is $\\frac{29 + 11}{14}$, or $\\frac{40}{14}$. Since $\\frac{40}{14} > \\frac{29}{13}$, the mean number of bursts for the new data set is greater than the mean number of bursts for the original data set. Therefore, of the median number of bursts and the mean number of bursts, only the mean number of bursts is greater for the new data set than for the original data set.

Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form $C=K a^{t}$, where $C$ is the estimated number of comments on the article $t$ hours after the article was first featured on the home page and $K$ and $a$ are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were $40$ comments on the article. This means that when $t = 0$, $C = 40$. Substituting $0$ for $t$ and $40$ for $C$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $40 = K a^{0}$, or $40 = K$. It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by $190\\%$ of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: $(40) (\\frac{190}{100})$, or $76$ comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is $40 + 76$, or $116$. This means that when $t = 1$, $C = 116$. Substituting $1$ for $t$, $116$ for $C$, and $40$ for $K$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $116 = 40 a^{1}$, or $116 = 40 a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $40$ yields $2.9 = a$. Substituting $40$ for $K$ and $2.9$ for $a$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $C=40(2.9)^{t}$. Thus, the equation that best represents this model is $C=40(2.9)^{t}$. Choice A is incorrect. This model represents a situation where the number of comments at the end of each hour increased by $19\\%$ of the number of comments at the end of the previous hour, rather than $190\\%$.

Let $x$ represent the first integer and $y$ represent the second integer. If the first integer is $5$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+5$. It's given that the product of the two integers is $462$ ; therefore $xy=462$. Substituting $2y+5$ for $x$ in this equation yields $(2y+5)(y)=462$, which can be written as $2y^2 + 5y = 462$. Subtracting $462$ from each side of this equation yields $2y^2 + 5y - 462 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2(-462)$, or $-924$, and whose sum is $5$. The two values whose product is $-924$ and whose sum is $5$ are $33$ and $-28$. Thus, the equation $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2y(y-14)+33(y-14) = 0$, or $(2y+33)(y-14) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2y + 33 = 0$ or $y - 14 = 0$. Subtracting $33$ from both sides of the equation $2y + 33 = 0$ yields $2y = -33$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $y = -\\frac{33}{2}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, the value of $y$ isn't $-\\frac{33}{2}$. Adding $14$ to both sides of the equation $y - 14 = 0$ yields $y = 14$. Substituting $14$ for $y$ in the equation $xy = 462$ yields $x(14)=462$.

It's given that triangle $ABC$ is similar to triangle $DEF$, where angle $A$ corresponds to angle $D$ and angles $C$ and $F$ are right angles. In similar triangles, the tangents of corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, if $\\tan A = \\frac{21}{20}$, then $\\tan D = \\frac{21}{20}$. In a right triangle, the tangent of an acute angle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. Therefore, in triangle $DEF$, if $\\tan D = \\frac{21}{20}$, the ratio of the length of $EF$ to the length of $DF$ is $\\frac{21}{20}$. If the lengths of $EF$ and $DF$ are $21$ and $20$, respectively, then the ratio of the length of $EF$ to the length of $DF$ is $\\frac{21}{20}$. In a right triangle, the sine of an acute angle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the hypotenuse. Therefore, the value of $\\sin D$ is the ratio of the length of $EF$ to the length of $DE$. The length of $DE$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if the lengths of the legs of a right triangle are $a$ and $b$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $c$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Therefore, if the lengths of $EF$ and $DF$ are $21$ and $20$, respectively, then $(21)^2 + (20)^2 = (DE)^2$, or $841 = (DE)^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $29 = DE$.

The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, $m=\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 -x_1}$. Substituting the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ for $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m=\\frac{10-3}{9-1}$, or $m=0.875$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for an appropriate linear model is approximately $0.875$. Substituting $0.875$ for $m$ in $y=mx+b$ yields $y=0.875x+b$. Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point $(1,3)$, the approximate value of $b$ can be found by substituting $1$ for $x$ and $3$ for $y$ in the equation $y=0.875x+b$, which yields $3=(0.875)(1)+b$, or $3=0.875+b$.

The value of $g(7 - w)$ is the value of $g(x)$ when $x = 7 - w$ , where $w$ is a constant.

Although I was not given the specific coordinates of the data points, I will provide a general explanation on how you could estimate the stopping distance if you have access to the graph:\n\n1. **Identify Nearby Data Points:**\n   - Locate the points on the graph that fall closest to 55 mph on the x-axis. Typically, the relevant points would be those immediately before and after 55 mph on the speed scale.\n\n2. **Interpolate Between Data Points:**\n   - Use linear interpolation to estimate the stopping distance between these two points. Linear interpolation assumes that stopping distance increases at a constant rate between the two given speed points.\n   - For example, if there is a point at 50 mph with a stopping distance of 200 feet and another at 60 mph with a stopping distance of 260 feet, you can estimate the stopping distance at 55 mph by finding the midpoint between 200 and 260.\n\n3. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - The difference between the known stopping distances at 50 mph and 60 mph is 60 feet (260 - 200).\n   - Since 55 mph is halfway between 50 mph and 60 mph, the stopping distance at 55 mph is halfway between 200 and 260 feet.\n   - Therefore, you add 30 feet (half of 60) to 200 feet, reaching an estimated stopping distance of 230 feet.\n\nGiven the answer options:\n- **A) 210 feet** and **B) 250 feet**\n\nFrom the above hypothetical interpolation, 230 feet is closer to 250 feet. Therefore, if the real graph is somewhat similar and the logical interpolation approach fits, the best estimate for the stopping distance at 55 mph would likely be closer to 250 feet.\n\nThus, I would lean towards option **B) 250**. However, please verify with the precise graphical data or interpolation as needed."}

Out of the 27 different numbers in this data set, 13 numbers are below the median, one number is exactly 33, and 13 numbers are above the median. When 7 is subtracted from each number below the median and added to each number above the median, the data spread out from the median.

Thus, the mean will not remain the same between the two data sets.

It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $f(x)$ is the height of the object $x$ seconds after it was launched, and $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, $k$, when $x = h$. Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of $1,034$ feet above the ground $8$ seconds after being launched, $f(x)$ reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = 8$. Therefore, $k = 1,034$ and $h = 8$. Substituting $8$ for $h$ and $1,034$ for $k$ in the function $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of $10$ feet above the ground, the value of $f(x)$ is $10$ when $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$ yields $10 = a(0 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $10 = 64a + 1,034$. Subtracting $1,034$ from both sides of this equation yields $64a = -1,024$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = -16$. Therefore, the model can be represented by the equation $f(x) = -16(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Substituting $10$ for $x$ in this equation yields $f(10) = -16(10 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $f(10) = 970$.

It's given that the logo is in the shape of a trapezoid that consists of three congruent equilateral triangles, and that the perimeter of the trapezoid is 20 centimeters (cm). Since the perimeter of the trapezoid is the sum of the lengths of 5 of the sides of the triangles, the length of each side of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{20}{5}=4 \\text{ centimeters}$ .

The shorter leg of each right triangle is half the length of the side of an equilateral triangle, or 2 cm. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ , the height of the equilateral triangle can be found. Substituting $a=2$ and $c=4$ and solving for b yields $\\sqrt{4^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{12} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\text{ centimeters}$ cm. The area of one equilateral triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} bh$ , where $b=2$ and $h=2 \\times \\sqrt{3}$ .

The diagonal of the rectangle is twice the length of the shortest side of the rectangle. The area of the rectangle is $1089\\sqrt{3}$ square units.\nWhat is the length, in units, of the diameter of the circle?", "Correct Answer": "66", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $66$. It's given that each vertex of the rectangle lies on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let $s$ represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it's given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, $2s$ represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $s$ for $a$ and $2s$ for $c$ in this equation yields $s^2 + b^2 = (2s)^2$, or $s^2 + b^2 = 4s^2$. Subtracting $s^2$ from both sides of this equation yields $b^2 = 3s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $b = s \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the length, in units, of the rectangle's longest side is $s \\sqrt{3}$. The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the shortest side and the length of the longest side. The lengths, in units, of the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle are represented by $s$ and $s \\sqrt{3}$, and it's given that the area of the rectangle is $1089 \\sqrt{3}$ square units. It follows that $1089 \\sqrt{3} = s ( s \\sqrt{3} \\right )$, or $1089 \\sqrt{3} = s^2 \\sqrt{3}$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $\\sqrt{3}$ yields $1089 = s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $33 = s$. Since the length, in units, of the diagonal is represented by $2s$, it follows that the length, in units, of the diagonal is $2 (33)$, or $66$.

Thus, if the value of the comic book at the end of $2011$ was $x$ dollars, and the value of the comic book at the end of $2013$ was $2.2428x$ dollars, then from the end of $2011$ to the end of $2013$, the value of the comic book increased by $2.2428x - 1x$, or $1.2428x$, dollars. Therefore, the increase in the value of the comic book from the end of $2011$ to the end of $2013$ is equal to $1.2428$ times the value of the comic book at the end of $2011$.

The x axis ranges from -6 to 5. The y axis ranges from -10 to 4. Refer to long description. The parabola opens upward. The vertex is at point (-1, -8). The parabola passes through the following points: (-2, -6) (-1, -8) (0, -6)", "Correct Answer": "-24", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $-24$. Since the graph passes through the point $(0, -6)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $0$, the value of $y$ is $-6$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $-6$ for $y$ in the given equation yields $-6=2(0)^2 + b(0)+c$, or $-6=c$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is $-6$. Substituting $-6$ for $c$ in the given equation yields $y=2x^2+bx-6$. Since the graph passes through the point $(-1,-8)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $-1$, the value of $y$ is $-8$. Substituting $-1$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in the equation $y=2x^2+bx-6$ yields $-8=2(-1)^2 + b(-1)-6$, or $-8=-4 - b$. Adding $4$ to each side of this equation yields $-4=-b$. Dividing each side of this equation by $-1$ yields $4=b$. Since the value of $b$ is $4$ and the value of $c$ is $-6$, it follows that the value of $bc$ is $(4)(-6)$, or $-24$. Alternate approach: The given equation represents a parabola in the xy-plane with a vertex at $(-1,-8)$. Therefore, the given equation, $y=2x^2+bx+c$, which is written in standard form, can be written in vertex form, $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola and $a$ is the value of the coefficient on the $x^2$ term when the equation is written in standard form. It follows that $a=2$. Substituting $2$ for $a$, $-1$ for $h$, and $-8$ for $k$ in this equation yields $y=2(x - (-1))^2 + (-8)$, or $y=2(x+1)^2 - 8$. Squaring the binomial on the right-hand side of this equation yields $y=2(x^2+2x+1)-8$. Multiplying each term inside the parentheses on the right-hand side of this equation by $2$ yields $y=2x^2+4x+2-8$, which is equivalent to $y=2x^2+4x-6$. From the given equation $y=2x^2+bx+c$, it follows that the value of $b$ is $4$ and the value of $c$ is $-6$.
