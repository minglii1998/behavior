Substituting $4r$ for b in this equation yields $r+4r=200$, or $5r=200$. Solving for r yields $r=40$.

The given system of equations can be solved using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the second equation in the given system by $-2$ yields $-2ty = -1 -4x$, or $-1 -4x = -2ty$. Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system, $4x -6y = 10y + 2$, yields $(4x -6y) + (-1 -4x) = (10y +2) + (-2ty)$, or $-1 -6y = 10y -2ty +2$. Subtracting $10y$ from both sides of this equation yields $(-1 -6y) - (10y) = (10y -2ty +2) - (10y)$, or $-1 -16y = -2ty +2$. If the given system has no solution, then the equation $-1 -16y = -2ty +2$ has no solution. If this equation has no solution, the coefficients of $y$ on each side of the equation, $-16$ and $-2t$, must be equal, which yields the equation $-16 = -2t$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $-2$ yields $8 = t$. Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of $t$ is $8$. Alternate approach: A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the x-coefficients is equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the x-coefficients are not equal to the ratio of the constant terms. Subtracting $10y$ from both sides of the first equation in the given system yields $(4x -6y) - (10y) = (10y +2) - (10y)$, or $4x -16y =2$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides of the second equation in the given system yields $(ty) - (2x) = (\\frac{1}{2} +2x) - (2x)$, or $-2x + ty = \\frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the x-coefficients for these equations is $-\\frac{2}{4}$, or $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the y-coefficients for these equations is $-\\frac{t}{16}$. The ratio of the constant terms for these equations is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{2}$, or $\\frac{1}{4}$. Since the ratio of the x-coefficients, $-\\frac{1}{2}$, is not equal to the ratio of the constants, $\\frac{1}{4}$, the lines represented by the equations are distinct. Setting the ratio of the x-coefficients equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients yields $-\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{t}{16}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $-16$ yields $( -\\frac{1}{2} ) ( -16 ) = ( -\\frac{t}{16} ) ( -16 )$, or $t =8$.

Substituting $8$ for $x1$, $0$ for $y1$, $3$ for $x2$, and $2$ for $y2$ in the equation $m = \\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}$ yields $m = \\frac{2 - 0}{3 - 8}$, or $m = -\\frac{2}{5}$. Substituting $-\\frac{2}{5}$ for $m$, $8$ for $x1$, and $0$ for $y1$ in the equation $y - y1 = m (x - x1)$ yields $y - 0 = -\\frac{2}{5} (x - 8)$, which is equivalent to $y = -\\frac{2}{5}x + \\frac{16}{5}$. Adding $\\frac{2}{5}x$ to both sides of this equation yields $\\frac{2}{5}x + y = \\frac{16}{5}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $10$ yields $4x + 10y = 32$.

Substituting $-x + 60$ for y in the equation $2x + 4y = 202$ yields $2x + 4 \\times (-x + 60) = 202$ . Distributing and combining like terms gives $-2x + 240 = 202$ .

However, the actual number of people who slept in tents was 202. The difference of 38 accounts for the 2-person tents. Since each of these tents holds 2 people fewer than a 4-person tent, $\\frac{38}{2} = 19$ gives the number of 2-person tents. Choice A is incorrect. This choice may result from assuming exactly half of the tents hold 2 people. If that were true, then the total number of people who slept in tents would be $2 \\times 30 + 4 \\times 30 = 180$ ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 180. Choice B is incorrect. If 20 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 40 tents would be 4-person tents.

Choice D is incorrect. If 18 tents were 2-person tents, then the remaining 42 tents would be 4-person tents. Since all the tents were filled to capacity, the total number of people who slept in tents would be $2 \\times 18 + 4 \\times 42 = 36 + 168 = 204$ ; however, the total number of people who slept in tents was 202, not 204.", "o1-mini (response)": "Let\u2019s define:\n- \\( x \\) = number of 2-person tents\n- \\( 60 - x \\) = number of 4-person tents\n\nThe total capacity can be expressed as:\n\\[ 2x + 4(60 - x) = 202 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n2x + 240 - 4x = 202 \\\\\n-2x + 240 = 202 \\\\\n-2x = 202 - 240 \\\\\n-2x = -38 \\\\\nx = 19\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** C) 19", "o1-mini (all_token_count)": 199, "o1-mini (thinking_token_count)": 64}

Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses $200h$ calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses $150b$ calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It's given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation $200h + 150b = 1900$ yields $200h + 150 \\times 2 = 1900$, or $200h + 300 = 1900$. Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields $200h = 1600$.

Let $x$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the first piece, and let $y$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the second piece. It's given that the sample has a total mass of $50.0$ grams. Therefore, the equation $x+y=50.0$ represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is $50.0\\%$ silicon by mass. Therefore, the total mass of the silicon in the sample is $0.500(50.0)$, or $25.0$, grams. It's also given that the first piece was $30.0\\%$ silicon by mass and the second piece was $80.0\\%$ silicon by mass. Therefore, the masses, in grams, of the silicon in the first and second pieces can be represented by the expressions $0.300x$ and $0.800y$, respectively. Since the sample was created by combining the first and second pieces, and the total mass of the silicon in the sample is $25.0$ grams, the equation $0.300x+0.800y=25.0$ represents this situation. Subtracting $y$ from both sides of the equation $x+y=50.0$ yields $x=50.0 - y$. Substituting $50.0 - y$ for $x$ in the equation $0.300(50.0 - y)$ yields $0.300(50.0 - y) + 0.800y = 25.0$. Distributing $0.300$ on the left-hand side of this equation yields $15.0 - 0.300y + 0.800y = 25.0$. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields $15.0 + 0.500y = 25.0$. Subtracting $15.0$ from both sides of this equation yields $0.500y = 10.0$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $0.500$ yields $y = 20.0$. Substituting $20.0$ for $y$ in the expression representing the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the second piece, $0.800y$, yields $0.800(20.0)$, or $16.0$.

Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to $-1$ divided by the slope of the second line.

It's given that the relationship between $x$ and $f(x)$ is linear. A linear function can be written in the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y -coordinate of the y -intercept of the graph of $y=f(x)$ in the xy -plane. Given two points on a line, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, the slope of the line can be found using the slope formula $m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. It's given that the company's profit is $220$ when it sells $8$ items and the profit is $320$ when it sells $10$ items.

If the owner pays $4.90$ per candle to purchase small candles and $11.\n60$ per candle to purchase large candles, what is the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase to stay within the budget and maintain the discounted pricing?", "Correct Answer": "182", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $182$. Let $s$ represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let $l$ represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It's given that the owner pays $4.90$ per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60$ per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays $4.90s$ dollars for $s$ small candles and $11.60 l$ dollars for $l$ large candles, which means the owner pays a total of $4.90s + 11.60 l$ dollars to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets $2,200$ to purchase candles. Therefore, $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$. It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of $200$ candles. Therefore, $s + l \\geq 200$. The inequalities $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$ and $s + l \\geq 200$ can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting $l$ from both sides of the inequality $s + l \\geq 200$ yields $s \\geq 200 - l$. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by $4.90$ yields $4.90s \\geq 4.90 (200 - l )$, or $4.90s \\geq 980 - 4.90 l$. Adding $11.60 l$ to both sides of this inequality yields $4.90s + 11.60 l \\geq 980 - 4.90 l + 11.60 l$, or $4.90s + 11.60 l \\geq 980 + 6.70 l$. This inequality can be combined with the inequality $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$, which yields the compound inequality $980 + 6.70 l \\leq 4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$. It follows that $980 + 6.70 l \\leq 2,200$. Subtracting $980$ from both sides of this inequality yields $6.70 l \\leq 2,200$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $6.70$ yields approximately $l \\leq 182.09$.

A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel.

Two pairs of the selling price P and the demand Q are given. Using the coordinate pairs $(P, Q)$, two points that satisfy the function are $(40,20000)$ and $60,15000)$. The slope m of the function can be found using the formula $m = \\frac{Q_{2} - Q_{1}}{P_{2} - P_{1}}$.

Therefore, the points $(1, 11)$ and $(2, 16)$ are on the line. Substituting $(1, 11)$ and $(2, 16)$ for $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m=\\frac{16 - 11}{2 - 1}$, or $m=5$. Substituting $5$ for $m$ in the equation $y=mx+b$ yields $y=5x+b$. Substituting the first value of $x$ in the table, $1$, and its corresponding value of $y$, $11$, for $x$ and $y$, respectively, in this equation yields $11=5(1) + b$, or $11 = b + 5$. Subtracting $5$ from both sides of this equation yields $6 = b$. Substituting $6$ for $b$ in the equation $y=5x+b$ yields $y=5x + 6$. Therefore, the equation $y=5x + 6$ represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. Choice B is incorrect. For this relationship, when the value of $x$ is $1$, the corresponding value of $y$ is $16$, not $11$. Choice C is incorrect. For this relationship, when the value of $x$ is $2$, the corresponding value of $y$ is $17$, not $16$. Choice D is incorrect.

Because it's given that the total revenue for this group was $1,440$ dollars, it must be true that $60x + 80y = 1,440$. The equations $x + y = 21$ and $60x + 80y = 1,440$ form a linear system of equations that can be solved to find the value of $x$, which represents the number of children in the group, using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the equation $x + y = 21$ by $80$ yields $80x + 80y = 1,680$. Subtracting $60x + 80y = 1,440$ from $80x + 80y = 1,680$ yields $(80x + 80y) - (60x + 80y) = 1,680 - 1,440$, which is equivalent to $80x - 60x + 80y - 80y = 240$, or $20x = 240$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $20$ yields $x = 12$. Therefore, $12$ people in the group were children. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

The equation of a parabola in the xy-plane can be written in the form $y = a (x - h)^2 + k$ , where $a$ is a constant and $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. If $a$ is positive, the parabola will open upward, and if $a$ is negative, the parabola will open downward. It's given that the parabola has vertex $(9, -14)$ . Substituting $9$ for $h$ and $-14$ for $k$ in the equation $y = a (x - h)^2 + k$ gives $y = a (x - 9)^2 - 14$ , which can be rewritten as $y = a (x - 9)(x - 9) - 14$ , or $y = a (x^2 - 18 x + 81) - 14$ . Distributing the factor of $a$ on the right-hand side of this equation yields $y = a x^2 - 18 a x + 81 a - 14$ . Therefore, the equation of the parabola, $y = a x^2 - 18 a x + 81 a - 14$ , can be written in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$ , where $a = a$, $b = -18 a$, and $c = 81 a - 14$ . Substituting $-18 a$ for $b$ and $81 a - 14$ for $c$ in the expression $a + b + c$ yields $(a) + (-18 a) + (81 a - 14)$ , or $64 a - 14$ . Since the vertex of the parabola, $(9, -14)$ , is below the x-axis, and it's given that the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, the parabola must open upward. Therefore, the constant $a$ must have a positive value. Setting the expression $64 a - 14$ equal to the value in choice D yields $64 a - 14 = -12$ . Adding $14$ to both sides of this equation yields $64 a = 2$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = \\frac{2}{64}$ , which is a positive value.

If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at $(9, -14)$ is written in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$ , where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants and $a + b + c = -23$ , then the value of $a$ will be negative, which means the parabola will open downward, not upward, and will intersect the x-axis at zero points, not two points.

The graph of the equation $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ in the xy -plane is a circle with center $(h,k)$ and a radius of length $r$. The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the xy -plane intersects the y -axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the y -axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius.

Functions $f$ and $g$ are both exponential functions with a base of $0.40$. Since $0.40$ is less than $1$, functions $f$ and $g$ are both decreasing exponential functions. This means that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ decrease as $x$ increases. Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ decrease as $x$ increases, the maximum value of each function occurs at the least value of $x$ for which the function is defined. It's given that functions $f$ and $g$ are defined for $x \\geq 0$. Therefore, the maximum value of each function occurs at $x=0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation defining $f$ yields $f(0)=33(0.4)^0+3$, which is equivalent to $f(0)=33(0.4)^3$, or $f(0)=2.112$. Therefore, the maximum value of $f$ is $2.112$. Since the equation $f(x)=33(0.4)^x+3$ doesn't display the value $2.112$, the equation defining $f$ doesn't display the maximum value of $f$.

Shifting circle A down two units is a rigid vertical translation of circle A that does not change its size or shape.

It's given that the graph of $y=f(x)$ in the xy-plane is a parabola with vertex $(h, k)$. If $f(-9)=f(3)$, then for the graph of $y=f(x)$, the point with an x-coordinate of $-9$ and the point with an x-coordinate of $3$ have the same y-coordinate. In the xy-plane, a parabola is a symmetric graph such that when two points have the same y-coordinate, these points are equidistant from the vertex, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinates of these two points. Therefore, for the graph of $y=f(x)$, the points with x-coordinates $-9$ and $3$ are equidistant from the vertex, $(h, k)$, and $h$ is halfway between $-9$ and $3$. The value that is halfway between $-9$ and $3$ is $\\frac{-9 + 3}{2}$, or $-3$. Therefore, $h=-3$. The equation defining $f$ can also be written in vertex form, $f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k$. Substituting $-3$ for $h$ in this equation yields $f(x)=a(x-(-3))^{2}+k$, or $f(x)=a(x+3)^{2}+k$. This equation is equivalent to $f(x)=a(x^{2}+6x+9)+k$, or $f(x)=a x^{2}+6a x+9a+k$. Since $f(x)=a x^{2}+4x+c$, it follows that $6a=4$ and $9a+k=c$. Dividing both sides of the equation $6a=4$ by $6$ yields $a=\\frac{4}{6}$, or $a=\\frac{2}{3}$.

A certain flat surface consists of two adjacent squares, where the side length, in meters, of the larger square is $3$ times the side length, in meters, of the smaller square.

It's given that the side length of the larger square is $3$ times the side length of the smaller square. This means that the area of the larger square is $3^2$, or $9$, times the area of the smaller square. If the area of the smaller square is represented by $x$, then the area of the larger square can be represented by $9x$. Therefore, the flat surface of the two adjacent squares has a total area of $x + 9x$, or $10x$.

Dividing each side of this equation by $290$ yields $x = 16$. Substituting $16$ for $x$ in the expression for the area of the larger square, $9x$, yields $9 (16)$, or $144$, square meters. Since the area of the larger square is $144$ square meters, the electric flux, in $\\text{volts} \\cdot \\text{ meters}$, of the electric field through the larger square can be determined by multiplying the area of the larger square by the strength of the electric field.

It's given that the two boxplots show the distribution of number of books read over the summer by the students in two different English classes. In a boxplot, the first vertical line represents the minimum value of the data set and the last vertical line represents the maximum value of the data set. The range of a data set is the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value. In class A, the maximum number of books read is $5$ and the minimum number of books read is $0$. The difference between those values is $5 - 0$, or $5$. Therefore, the range of the number of books read in class A is $5$. In class B, the maximum number of books read is $10$ and the minimum number of books read is $1$. The difference between those values is $10 - 1$, or $9$. Therefore, the range of the number of books read in class B is $9$. To find the positive difference between the ranges of the number of books read for the two classes, the smaller range must be subtracted from the larger range.

It's given that segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$. Extending segment $BC$ at point $C$ and extending segment $DE$ at point $D$ until the two segments intersect results in a transversal that intersects two parallel line segments. One of these intersection points is point $B$, and let the other intersection point be point $X$. Since segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $DE$, alternate interior angles are congruent. Angle $CXD$ and the exterior angle formed by extending segment $AB$ at point $B$ are alternate interior angles. Therefore, the measure of angle $CXD$ is $41$ degrees. It's given that the measure of angle $D$ in pentagon $ABCDE$ is $174$ degrees. Therefore, angle $CDX$ has measure $180 - 174$, or $6$, degrees. Since angle $C$ in pentagon $ABCDE$ is an exterior angle of triangle $CDX$, it follows that the measure of angle $C$ is the sum of the measures of angles $CDX$ and $CXD$.

According to the given information, multiplying a tree species' growth factor by the tree's diameter is a method to approximate the age of the tree.

A pin oak with a diameter of 12 inches (or 1 foot) has a given growth factor of 3 and is approximately 36 years old. The diameters of the two trees 10 years from now can be found by dividing each tree's age in 10 years, 70 years, and 46 years, by its respective growth factor. This yields 14 inches and $15 \\frac{1}{3}$ inches. The difference between $15 \\frac{1}{3}$ and 14 is $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ , or approximately 1.3 inches. Alternate approach: Since a white birch has a growth factor of 5, the age increases at a rate of 5 years per inch or, equivalently, the diameter increases at a rate of $\\frac{1}{5}$ of an inch per year. Likewise, the pin oak has a growth factor of 3, so its diameter increases at a rate of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of an inch per year.

At a time of 10.0 seconds, the total distance traveled by the object is 50.0 meters, and at a time of 20.0 seconds, the total distance traveled by the object is 200.0 meters. \nIf the object was at a distance of 0 meters when $t=0$, then what is the total distance traveled, in meters, by the object after 30.0 seconds?", "Correct Answer": "450", "Rationale": "The correct answer is 450. The quadratic equation that models this situation can be written in the form $d = a t^{2} + b t + c$, where a, b, and c are constants. It's given that the distance, d, the object traveled was 0 meters when $t=0$ seconds. These values can be substituted into the equation to solve for a, b, and c: $0 = a \\cdot 0^2 + b \\cdot 0 + c$. Therefore, $c=0$, and it follows that $d = a t^{2} + b t$. Since it's also given that d is 50 when t is 10 and d is 200 when t is 20, these values for d and t can be substituted to create a system of two linear equations: $50 = a \\cdot 10^2 + b \\cdot 10$ and $200 = a \\cdot 20^2 + b \\cdot 20$, or $10a + b = 5$ and $20a + b = 10$.

Therefore, the equation that represents this situation is $d = \\frac{1}{2} t^{2}$.

It's given that $f(0)=86$ and that for each increase in $x$ by $1$, the value of $f(x)$ decreases by $80\\%$. Because the output of the function decreases by a constant percentage for each $1$-unit increase in the value of $x$, this relationship can be represented by an exponential function of the form $f(x)=a(b)^x$, where $a$ represents the initial value of the function and $b$ represents the rate of decay, expressed as a decimal. Because $f(0)=86$, the value of $a$ must be $86$. Because the value of $f(x)$ decreases by $80\\%$ for each $1$-unit increase in $x$, the value of $b$ must be $(1-0.80)$, or $0.2$. Therefore, the function $f$ can be defined by $f(x)=86(0.2)^x$. Substituting $2$ for $x$ in this function yields $f(2)=86(0.2)^2$, which is equivalent to $f(2)=86(0.04)$, or $f(2)=3.44$.

Since $\\overline{PR}$ and $\\overline{QS}$ are diameters of the circle shown, $\\overline{OS}$, $\\overline{OR}$, $\\overline{OP}$, and $\\overline{OQ}$ are radii of the circle and are therefore congruent. Since $\\angle SOP$ and $\\angle ROQ$ are vertical angles, they are congruent.

It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ , where $f(x)$ is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, $x$ seconds after the launch, $a$ is a constant, and $k$ is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached $h$ seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Therefore, $k=51.1$ and $h=3$ . Substituting $51.1$ for $k$ and $3$ for $h$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground. Therefore, when $x=0$ , $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $7$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = a(0 - 3)^2 + 51.1$ , or $7 = 9a + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = 9a$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $9$ yields $-4.9 = a$ . Substituting $-4.9$ for $a$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Therefore, the equation $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground $x$ seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters is the value of $x$ when $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $7$ for $f(x)$ in $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = -4.9(x - 3)^2$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $-4.9$ yields $9 = (x - 3)^2$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: $3 = x - 3$ and $-3 = x - 3$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $3 = x - 3$ yields $6 = x$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $-3 = x - 3$ yields $0 = x$ . Since $0$ seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, $6$ must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took $3$ seconds to travel from $7$ meters above the ground to its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take $3$ more seconds to travel from its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground back to $7$ meters above the ground.

Let $x$ be the first integer and let $y$ be the second integer. If the first integer is $11$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+11$. If the product of the two integers is $546$, then $xy=546$. Substituting $2y+11$ for $x$ in this equation results in $(2y+11)y=546$. Distributing the $y$ to both terms in the parentheses results in $2y^2 + 11y = 546$. Subtracting $546$ from both sides of this equation results in $2y^2 + 11y - 546 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2(-546)$, or $-1092$, and whose sum is $11$. The two values whose product is $-1092$ and whose sum is $11$ are $39$ and $-28$. Thus, the equation $2y^2 + 11y - 546 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2y^2 + 28y - 39y - 546 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2y(y-14) + 39(y-14) = 0$, or $(2y+39)(y-14) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2y+39=0$ and $y-14=0$. Subtracting $39$ from both sides of the equation $2y+39=0$ yields $2y=-39$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $y=-\\frac{39}{2}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, the value of $y$ is not $-\\frac{39}{2}$.

The angle above m and to the right of the left line segment is labeled y degrees. The figure is not drawn to scale", "Correct Answer": "B", "Rationale": "Choice B is correct. Let the measure of the third angle in the smaller triangle be $a^{\\circ}$. Since lines $l$ and m are parallel and cut by transversals, it follows that the corresponding angles formed are congruent. So $a^{\\circ} = y^{\\circ} = 20^{\\circ}$. The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$, which for the interior angles in the smaller triangle yields $a + x + z = 180$. Given that $z = 60$ and $a = 20$, it follows that $20 + x + 60 = 180$. Solving for x gives $x = 180 - 60 - 20$, or $x = 100$. Choice A is incorrect and may result from incorrectly assuming that angles $x + z = 180$. Choice C is incorrect and may result from incorrectly assuming that the smaller triangle is a right triangle, with x as the right angle.

The equation of a circle in the xy-plane with its center at $(h, k)$ and a radius of $r$ can be written in the form $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$. It's given that a circle in the xy-plane has its center at $(-5, 2)$ and has a radius of $9$. Substituting $-5$ for $h$, $2$ for $k$, and $9$ for $r$ in the equation $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$ yields $(x - (-5))^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 9^2$, or $(x + 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 81$.

A trigonometric ratio can be found using the unit circle, that is, a circle with radius $1$ unit. If a central angle of a unit circle in the xy-plane centered at the origin has its starting side on the positive x-axis and its terminal side intersects the circle at a point $(x, y)$, then the value of the tangent of the central angle is equal to the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate.

It's given that in triangle $RST$ , angle $T$ is a right angle. The area of a right triangle can be found using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} l_1 l_2$ , where $A$ represents the area of the right triangle, $l_1$ represents the length of one leg of the triangle, and $l_2$ represents the length of the other leg of the triangle. In triangle $RST$ , the two legs are $\\overline{RT}$ and $\\overline{ST}$ . Therefore, if the length of $\\overline{RT}$ is $72$ and the area of triangle $RST$ is $792$ , then $792 = \\frac{1}{2} (72) \\overline{ST}$ , or $792 = (36) \\overline{ST}$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $36$ yields $22 = \\overline{ST}$ . Therefore, the length of $\\overline{ST}$ is $22$ . It's also given that point $L$ lies on $\\overline{RS}$ , point $K$ lies on $\\overline{ST}$ , and $\\overline{LK}$ is parallel to $\\overline{RT}$ . It follows that angle $\\overline{LKS}$ is a right angle. Since triangles $RST$ and $\\overline{LSK}$ share angle $S$ and have right angles $T$ and $K$ , respectively, triangles $RST$ and $\\overline{LSK}$ are similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the length of $\\overline{RT}$ to the length of $\\overline{LK}$ is equal to the ratio of the length of $\\overline{ST}$ to the length of $\\overline{SK}$ . If the length of $\\overline{RT}$ is $72$ and the length of $\\overline{LK}$ is $24$ , it follows that the ratio of the length of $\\overline{RT}$ to the length of $\\overline{LK}$ is $\\frac{72}{24}$ , or $3$ , so the ratio of the length of $\\overline{ST}$ to the length of $\\overline{SK}$ is $3$ .

Since the length of $\\overline{ST}$ , $22$ , is the sum of the length of $\\overline{SK}$ , $\\frac{22}{3}$ , and the length of $\\overline{KT}$ , it follows that the length of $\\overline{KT}$ is $22 - \\frac{22}{3}$ , or $\\frac{44}{3}$ .

Substituting $-1$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k$ gives $10=a(-1-h)^{2}+k$, which is equivalent to $10=a(1+2h+h^{2})+k$, or $10=a+2ah+ah^{2}+k$.

A note indicates the figure is not drawn to scale.", "Correct Answer": "480", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $480$. It's given in the figure that angle $\\angle ACB$ and angle $\\angle AED$ are right angles. It follows that angle $\\angle ACB$ is congruent to angle $\\angle AED$ . It's also given that angle $\\angle BAC$ and angle $\\angle DAE$ are the same angle. It follows that angle $\\angle BAC$ is congruent to angle $\\angle DAE$ . Since triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ADE$ have two pairs of congruent angles, the triangles are similar. Sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ in triangle $\\triangle ABC$ correspond to sides $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ , respectively, in triangle $\\triangle ADE$ . Corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional. Therefore, $\\frac{\\overline{AD}}{\\overline{AB}} = \\frac{\\overline{AE}}{\\overline{AC}}$ . It's given that $\\overline{AC} = 3$ units and $\\overline{CE} = 21$ units. Therefore, $\\overline{AE} = 24$ units. It's also given that $\\overline{AB} = \\sqrt{34}$ units. Substituting $3$ for $\\overline{AC}$ , $24$ for $\\overline{AE}$ , and $\\sqrt{34}$ for $\\overline{AB}$ in the equation $\\frac{\\overline{AD}}{\\overline{AB}} = \\frac{\\overline{AE}}{\\overline{AC}}$ yields $\\frac{\\overline{AD}}{\\sqrt{34}} = \\frac{24}{3}$ , or $\\frac{\\overline{AD}}{\\sqrt{34}} = 8$ . Multiplying each side of this equation by $\\sqrt{34}$ yields $\\overline{AD} = 8\\sqrt{34}$. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$ , then $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$ . Since triangle $\\triangle ADE$ is a right triangle, it follows that $\\overline{AD}$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, $c$ , and $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ represent the lengths of the legs, $a$ and $b$ . Substituting $24$ for $b$ and $8 \\sqrt{34}$ for $c$ in the equation $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$ yields $a^{2} + (24)^{2} = (8 \\sqrt{34})^{2}$ , which is equivalent to $a^{2} + 576 = 64 (34)$ , or $a^{2} + 576 = 2176$ . Subtracting $576$ from both sides of this equation yields $a^{2} = 1600$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $a = \\pm 40$ . Since $a$ represents a length, which must be positive, the value of $a$ is $40$ . Therefore, $\\overline{DE} = 40$ . Since $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ represent the lengths of the legs of triangle $\\triangle ADE$ , it follows that $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ can be used to calculate the area, in square units, of the triangle as $\\frac{1}{2}(40)(24)$ , or $480$ .

The equation has exactly one real solution.\nWhat is the minimum possible value of $4k$?", "Correct Answer": "231", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $231$. It's given that $\\sqrt{k - x} = 58 - x$. Squaring both sides of this equation yields $k - x = (58 - x)^2$, which is equivalent to the given equation if $58 - x > 0$. It follows that if a solution to the equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ satisfies $58 - x > 0$, then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ can be rewritten as $k - x = 3,364 - 116x + x^2$. Adding $x$ to both sides of this equation yields $k = x^2 - 115x + 3,364$. Subtracting $k$ from both sides of this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$. The number of solutions to a quadratic equation in the form $0 = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, can be determined by the value of the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$. Substituting $-115$ for $b$, $1$ for $a$, and $3,364 - k$ for $c$ in $b^2 - 4ac$ yields $(-115)^2 - 4(1)(3,364 - k)$, or $4k - 231$. The equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution if the discriminant is equal to zero, or $4k - 231 = 0$. Subtracting $231$ from both sides of this equation yields $4k = 231$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $k = 57.75$. Therefore, if $k = 57.75$, then the equation $0 = x^2 - 115x + (3,364 - k)$ has exactly one real solution. Substituting $57.75$ for $k$ in this equation yields $0 = x^2 - 115x + 3,306.25$, which is equivalent to $0 = (x - 57.5)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $0 = x - 57.5$. Adding $57.5$ to both sides of this equation yields $57.5 = x$. To check whether this solution satisfies $58 - x > 0$, the solution, $57.5$, can be substituted for $x$ in $58 - x > 0$, which yields $58 - 57.5 > 0$, or $0.5 > 0$. Since $0.5 > 0$, it follows that if $k = 57.75$, or $4k = 231$, then the given equation has exactly one real solution.

Let x be the number of years after 1985. It follows that $\\frac{x}{2}$ represents the number of 2-year periods that will occur within an x-year period.

Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double $\\frac{x}{2}$ \\times. Since the number of transistors included on a microprocessor was 275,000, or .275 million, in 1985, the estimated number of transistors, in millions, included x years after 1985 can be modeled as $0.275 \\times 2^{x/2}$. The year in which the number of transistors is estimated to be 1.1 million is represented by the value of x when $1.1 = 0.275 \\times 2^{x/2}$.

It's given that the graphs of the equations in the given system intersect at exactly one point, $( x, y )$, in the xy-plane. Therefore, $( x, y )$ is the only solution to the given system of equations. The given system of equations can be solved by subtracting the second equation, $y = 3x + a$, from the first equation, $y = 2x^2 - 21x + 64$. This yields $y - y = (2x^2 - 21x + 64) - (3x + a)$, or $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 - a$. Since the given system has only one solution, this equation has only one solution. A quadratic equation in the form $r x^2 + s x + t = 0$, where $r$, $s$, and $t$ are constants, has one solution if and only if the discriminant, $s^2 - 4 r t$, is equal to zero. Substituting $2$ for $r$, $-24$ for $s$, and $-a + 64$ for $t$ in the expression $s^2 - 4 r t$ yields $( -24 )^2 - (4) (2) (64 - a)$. Setting this expression equal to zero yields $( -24 )^2 - (4) (2) (64 - a) = 0$, or $8a + 64 = 0$. Subtracting $64$ from both sides of this equation yields $8a = -64$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $8$ yields $a = -8$. Substituting $-8$ for $a$ in the equation $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 - a$ yields $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 + 8$, or $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 72$.

In this equation, $b$ represents the time, in seconds, at which the softball reaches its maximum height of $c$ meters above the ground. It's given that this softball reaches a maximum height of $51.84$ meters above the ground at $1.8$ seconds; therefore, $b = 1.8$ and $c = 51.84$. Substituting $1.8$ for $b$ and $51.84$ for $c$ in the equation $h = -a (t - b)^2 + c$ yields $h = -a (t - 1.8)^2 + 51.84$. It's also given that this softball hits the ground at $3.6$ seconds; therefore, $h = 0$ when $t = 3.6$. Substituting $0$ for $h$ and $3.6$ for $t$ in the equation $h = -a (t - 1.8)^2 + 51.84$ yields $0 = -a (3.6 - 1.8)^2 + 51.84$, which is equivalent to $0 = -3.24 a + 51.84$.

It's given that the radius of the circle is $168$ millimeters. Since points $M$ and $N$ both lie on the circle, segments $GM$ and $GN$ are both radii. Therefore, segments $GM$ and $GN$ each have length $168$ millimeters. Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment $MH$ and segment $NH$ have equal length. Let $x$ represent the length of segment $MH$. Then $x$ also represents the length of segment $NH$. It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral $GMHN$ is $3856$ millimeters. Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, $3856 = 168 + 168 + x + x$, or $3856 = 336 + 2x$. Subtracting $336$ from both sides of this equation yields $3520 = 2x$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $1760 = x$. Therefore, the length of segment $MH$ is $1760$ millimeters. A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment $GM$ is perpendicular to segment $MH$. Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle $GMH$ is a right angle. Therefore, triangle $GMH$ is a right triangle with legs of length $1760$ millimeters and $168$ millimeters, and hypotenuse $GH$. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For an equation in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\\frac{b}{2a}$. For the equation $f(x)=x^2 + 3x - 130$, $a = 1$, $b = 3$, and $c = -130$. It follows that the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\\frac{3}{2}$, or $-\\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, $f(x)$ reaches its minimum when the value of $x$ is $-\\frac{3}{2}$. Alternate approach: The value of $x$ for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the parabola. Since it's given that $f(x)=(x-10)(x+13)$, it follows that the two x-intercepts of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the xy-plane occur when $x = 10$ and $x = -13$, or at the points $(10, 0)$ and $(-13, 0)$. The midpoint between two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, is $(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})$. Therefore, the midpoint between $(10, 0)$ and $(-13, 0)$ is $(\\frac{10 + (-13)}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2})$, or $(-\\frac{3}{2}, 0)$. It follows that $f(x)$ reaches its minimum when the value of $x$ is $-\\frac{3}{2}$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the xy-plane.

It's given that $f$ is a quadratic function. It follows that $f$ can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants. It's also given that the table shows three values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$, where $y = f(x) + 4$. Substituting $a(x - h)^2 + k$ for $f(x)$ in this equation yields $y = a(x - h)^2 + k + 4$. This equation represents a quadratic relationship between $x$ and $y$, where $k + 4$ is either the maximum or the minimum value of $y$, which occurs when $x = h$. For quadratic relationships between $x$ and $y$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at the value of $x$ halfway between any two values of $x$ that have the same corresponding value of $y$. The table shows that x -values of $21$ and $25$ correspond to the same y -value, $-8$. Since $23$ is halfway between $21$ and $25$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at an x -value of $23$. The table shows that when $x = 23$, $y = 8$. It follows that $h = 23$ and $k + 4 = 8$. Subtracting $4$ from both sides of the equation $k + 4 = 8$ yields $k = 4$. Substituting $23$ for $h$ and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k + 4$ yields $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 4 + 4$, or $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 8$. The value of $a$ can be found by substituting any x -value and its corresponding y -value for $x$ and $y$, respectively, in this equation. Substituting $25$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in this equation yields $-8 = (25 - 23)^2 + 8$, or $-8 = (2)^2 + 8$. Subtracting $8$ from both sides of this equation yields $-16 = (2)^2 a$, or $-16 = 4a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $-4 = a$. Substituting $-4$ for $a$, $23$ for $h$, and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = -4(x - 23)^2 + 4$.

It's given that the dot plot represents a data set of the number of bursts for $13$ eruptions of a steam vent. The median of a data set with an odd number of elements is the middle element when the elements are in numerical order. For $13$ elements in numerical order, this is the $7th$ element. For this data set, the first $4$ elements have a value of $1$, and the next $5$ elements have a value of $2$. Thus, the $7th$ element in the ordered data set is $2$ and the median number of bursts for the original data set is $2$. If an additional eruption with $11$ bursts is added to this data set to create a new data set of $14$ eruptions, the median of the new data set will be between the $7th$ and $8th$ elements in the ordered set, which will also be $2$. Therefore, the median number of bursts for the new data set will be the same as the median number of bursts for the original data set. The mean number of bursts for the original data set is found by adding the values of all $13$ elements and dividing that sum by the number of elements, $13$. Since the data is shown in a dot plot, the sum of the values of the elements can be found by multiplying each element's value by its frequency: $1(4) + 2(5) + 3(2) + 4(1) + 5(1)$, or $29$.

Since $\\frac{40}{14} > \\frac{29}{13}$, the mean number of bursts for the new data set is greater than the mean number of bursts for the original data set.

It's given that an exponential model estimates that the number of comments on an article increased by a fixed percentage at the end of each hour. Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form $C=K a^{t}$, where $C$ is the estimated number of comments on the article $t$ hours after the article was first featured on the home page and $K$ and $a$ are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were $40$ comments on the article. This means that when $t = 0$, $C = 40$. Substituting $0$ for $t$ and $40$ for $C$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $40 = K a^{0}$, or $40 = K$. It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by $190\\%$ of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: $(40) (\\frac{190}{100})$, or $76$ comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is $40 + 76$, or $116$. This means that when $t = 1$, $C = 116$. Substituting $1$ for $t$, $116$ for $C$, and $40$ for $K$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $116 = 40 a^{1}$, or $116 = 40 a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $40$ yields $2.9 = a$. Substituting $40$ for $K$ and $2.9$ for $a$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $C=40(2.9)^{t}$.

An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length and all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$. The height of the triangle, $k \\sqrt{3}$, is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the $60^\\circ$ angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle. Since the altitude has a length of $k \\sqrt{3}$, it follows from the properties of 30-60-90 right triangles that the side across from each $30^\\circ$ angle has a length of $k$ and each hypotenuse has a length of $2k$. In this case, the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is $2k$. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of each side. It's given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is $624$; therefore, $2k + 2k + 2k = 624$, or $6k = 624$.

It's given that $f(x)=(x-14)(x+19)$, which can be rewritten as $f(x)=x^2 + 5x -266$.

Substituting $432$ for $V$ and $24$ for $\\pi r^2$ in the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$ yields $432 = 24 h$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $24$ yields $18 = h$. Therefore, the height of the cylinder, in centimeters, is $18$. Choice B is incorrect. This is the area of the base, in square centimeters, not the height, in centimeters, of the cylinder.

Let $x$ represent the first integer and $y$ represent the second integer. If the first integer is $5$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+5$. It's given that the product of the two integers is $462$ ; therefore $xy=462$. Substituting $2y+5$ for $x$ in this equation yields $(2y+5)(y)=462$, which can be written as $2y^2 + 5y = 462$. Subtracting $462$ from each side of this equation yields $2y^2 + 5y - 462 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2(-462)$, or $-924$, and whose sum is $5$. The two values whose product is $-924$ and whose sum is $5$ are $33$ and $-28$. Thus, the equation $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2y(y-14)+33(y-14) = 0$, or $(2y+33)(y-14) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2y + 33 = 0$ or $y - 14 = 0$. Subtracting $33$ from both sides of the equation $2y + 33 = 0$ yields $2y = -33$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $y = -\\frac{33}{2}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, the value of $y$ isn't $-\\frac{33}{2}$. Adding $14$ to both sides of the equation $y - 14 = 0$ yields $y = 14$. Substituting $14$ for $y$ in the equation $xy = 462$ yields $x(14)=462$.

Therefore, if the lengths of $EF$ and $DF$ are $21$ and $20$, respectively, then $(21)^2 + (20)^2 = (DE)^2$, or $841 = (DE)^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $29 = DE$. Therefore, if the lengths of $EF$ and $DF$ are $21$ and $20$, respectively, then the length of $DE$ is $29$ and the ratio of the length of $EF$ to the length of $DE$ is $\\frac{21}{29}$. Thus, if $\\tan A = \\frac{21}{20}$, the value of $\\sin D$ is $\\frac{21}{29}$.

A linear model can be written in the form $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the model in the xy-plane and $(0,b)$ is the y-intercept. The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, $m=\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 -x_1}$. Substituting the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ for $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m=\\frac{10-3}{9-1}$, or $m=0.875$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for an appropriate linear model is approximately $0.875$. Substituting $0.875$ for $m$ in $y=mx+b$ yields $y=0.875x+b$. Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point $(1,3)$, the approximate value of $b$ can be found by substituting $1$ for $x$ and $3$ for $y$ in the equation $y=0.875x+b$, which yields $3=(0.875)(1)+b$, or $3=0.875+b$. Subtracting $0.875$ from both sides of this equation yields $2.125=b$. Therefore, the value of $b$ for an appropriate linear model is approximately $2.125$.

Alternate approach: A linear model can be written in the form $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the model in the xy-plane and $(0,b)$ is the y-intercept.

Applying properties of exponents, this expression can be rewritten as $(70n)^{\\frac{1}{5}} (70n)^{\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 2}$, or $(70n)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$, which can be rewritten as $(70n)^{\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{3}}$, or $(70n)^{\\frac{8}{15}}$. It's given that the expression $\\sqrt[5]{70n} (\\sqrt[6]{70n})^2$ is equivalent to $(70n)^{30x}$, where $n > 1$. It follows that $(70n)^{\\frac{8}{15}}$ is equivalent to $(70n)^{30x}$.

One way to find the radius of the circle is to rewrite the given equation in standard form, $(x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}$ , where $h,k$ is the center of the circle and the radius of the circle is r. To do this, divide the original equation, $2x^{2}-6x+2y^{2}+2y=45$ , by 2 to make the leading coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ each equal to 1: $x^{2}-3x+y^{2}+y=22.5$ . Then complete the square to put the equation in standard form. To do so, first rewrite $x^{2}-3x+y^{2}+y=22.5$ as $(x^{2}-3x+2.25) -2.25 + (y^{2}+y+0.25) -0.25=22.5$ . Second, add 2.25 and 0.25 to both sides of the equation: $(x^{2}-3x+2.25)+(y^{2}+y+0.25)=25$ . Since $x^{2}-3x+2.25=(x-1.5)^{2}$ , $y^{2}+y+0.25=(y+0.5)^{2}$ , and $25=5^{2}$ , it follows that $(x-1.5)^{2}+(y+0.5)^{2}=5^{2}$ . Therefore, the radius of the circle is 5.

The value of $g(7 - w)$ is the value of $g(x)$ when $x = 7 - w$ , where $w$ is a constant. Substituting $7 - w$ for $x$ in the given equation yields $g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ , which is equivalent to $g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ . It's given that the value of $g(7 - w)$ is $0$ . Substituting $0$ for $g(7 - w)$ in the equation $g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ yields $0 = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2$ . Since the product of the three factors on the right-hand side of this equation is equal to $0$ , at least one of these three factors must be equal to $0$ .

Adding $w$ to both sides of this equation yields $7 = w$ . Therefore, $7$ is one possible value of $w$ . Setting the second factor equal to $0$ yields $5 - w = 0$ . Adding $w$ to both sides of this equation yields $5 = w$ . Therefore, $5$ is a second possible value of $w$ . Setting the third factor equal to $0$ yields $(13 - w)^2 = 0$ .

It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $f(x)$ is the height of the object $x$ seconds after it was launched, and $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, $k$, when $x = h$. Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of $1,034$ feet above the ground $8$ seconds after being launched, $f(x)$ reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = 8$. Therefore, $k = 1,034$ and $h = 8$. Substituting $8$ for $h$ and $1,034$ for $k$ in the function $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of $10$ feet above the ground, the value of $f(x)$ is $10$ when $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$ yields $10 = a(0 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $10 = 64a + 1,034$. Subtracting $1,034$ from both sides of this equation yields $64a = -1,024$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = -16$. Therefore, the model can be represented by the equation $f(x) = -16(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Substituting $10$ for $x$ in this equation yields $f(10) = -16(10 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $f(10) = 970$.

It's given that the logo is in the shape of a trapezoid that consists of three congruent equilateral triangles, and that the perimeter of the trapezoid is 20 centimeters (cm). Since the perimeter of the trapezoid is the sum of the lengths of 5 of the sides of the triangles, the length of each side of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{20}{5}=4 \\text{ centimeters}$ . Dividing up one equilateral triangle into two right triangles yields a pair of congruent 30$^{\\circ}$-60$^{\\circ}$-90$^{\\circ}$ triangles. The shorter leg of each right triangle is half the length of the side of an equilateral triangle, or 2 cm. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ , the height of the equilateral triangle can be found.

In the triangle shown, the measure of angle $B$ is $30 degree$ and angle $C$ is a right angle, which means that it has a measure of $90 degree$.

The median of a data set with an odd number of values that are in ascending or descending order is the middle value of the data set. Since the distribution of the values of both data set A and data set B form symmetric dot plots, and each data set has an odd number of values, it follows that the median is given by the middle value in each of the dot plots. Thus, the median of data set A is $13$, and the median of data set B is $13$. Therefore, statement I is true. Data set A and data set B have the same frequency for each of the values $11$, $12$, $14$, and $15$. Data set A has a frequency of $1$ for values $10$ and $16$, whereas data set B has a frequency of $2$ for values $10$ and $16$. Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a data set; it is larger when there are more values further from the mean, and smaller when there are more values closer to the mean. Since both distributions are symmetric with an odd number of values, the mean of each data set is equal to its median. Thus, each data set has a mean of $13$. Since more of the values in data set A are closer to $13$ than data set B, it follows that data set A has a smaller standard deviation than data set B. Thus, statement II is false.

The diagonal of the rectangle is twice the length of the shortest side of the rectangle. The area of the rectangle is $1089\\sqrt{3}$ square units.\nWhat is the length, in units, of the diameter of the circle?", "Correct Answer": "66", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $66$. It's given that each vertex of the rectangle lies on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let $s$ represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it's given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, $2s$ represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $s$ for $a$ and $2s$ for $c$ in this equation yields $s^2 + b^2 = (2s)^2$, or $s^2 + b^2 = 4s^2$. Subtracting $s^2$ from both sides of this equation yields $b^2 = 3s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $b = s \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the length, in units, of the rectangle's longest side is $s \\sqrt{3}$. The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the shortest side and the length of the longest side. The lengths, in units, of the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle are represented by $s$ and $s \\sqrt{3}$, and it's given that the area of the rectangle is $1089 \\sqrt{3}$ square units. It follows that $1089 \\sqrt{3} = s ( s \\sqrt{3} \\right )$, or $1089 \\sqrt{3} = s^2 \\sqrt{3}$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $\\sqrt{3}$ yields $1089 = s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $33 = s$. Since the length, in units, of the diagonal is represented by $2s$, it follows that the length, in units, of the diagonal is $2 (33)$, or $66$.

The parabola passes through the following points: (-2, -6) (-1, -8) (0, -6)", "Correct Answer": "-24", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $-24$. Since the graph passes through the point $(0, -6)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $0$, the value of $y$ is $-6$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $-6$ for $y$ in the given equation yields $-6=2(0)^2 + b(0)+c$, or $-6=c$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is $-6$. Substituting $-6$ for $c$ in the given equation yields $y=2x^2+bx-6$. Since the graph passes through the point $(-1,-8)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $-1$, the value of $y$ is $-8$. Substituting $-1$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in the equation $y=2x^2+bx-6$ yields $-8=2(-1)^2 + b(-1)-6$, or $-8=-4 - b$. Adding $4$ to each side of this equation yields $-4=-b$. Dividing each side of this equation by $-1$ yields $4=b$. Since the value of $b$ is $4$ and the value of $c$ is $-6$, it follows that the value of $bc$ is $(4)(-6)$, or $-24$. Alternate approach: The given equation represents a parabola in the xy-plane with a vertex at $(-1,-8)$. Therefore, the given equation, $y=2x^2+bx+c$, which is written in standard form, can be written in vertex form, $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola and $a$ is the value of the coefficient on the $x^2$ term when the equation is written in standard form. It follows that $a=2$. Substituting $2$ for $a$, $-1$ for $h$, and $-8$ for $k$ in this equation yields $y=2(x - (-1))^2 + (-8)$, or $y=2(x+1)^2 - 8$. Squaring the binomial on the right-hand side of this equation yields $y=2(x^2+2x+1)-8$. Multiplying each term inside the parentheses on the right-hand side of this equation by $2$ yields $y=2x^2+4x+2-8$, which is equivalent to $y=2x^2+4x-6$.

The standard form of an equation of a circle in the xy -plane is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ , where the coordinates of the center of the circle are $(h,k)$ and the length of the radius of the circle is $r$. For the circle in the xy -plane with equation $(x-5)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 16$, it follows that $r^2=16$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $r=4$ or $r=-4$. Because $r$ represents the length of the radius of the circle and this length must be positive, $r=4$. Therefore, the radius of the circle is $4$. The diameter of a circle is twice the length of the radius of the circle. Thus, $2(4)$ yields $8$. Therefore, the diameter of the circle is $8$. Choice A is incorrect.
