It's given that she biked for twice as many hours as she ran, so this can be represented by the equation $\\frac{b}{10} = 2 \\times \\frac{r}{5}$, which can be rewritten as $b=4r$. It's also given that she ran r miles and biked b miles, and that she ran and biked a total of 200 miles. This can be represented by the equation $r+b=200$. Substituting $4r$ for b in this equation yields $r+4r=200$, or $5r=200$. Solving for r yields $r=40$. Determining the number of miles she biked, b, can be found by substituting 40 for r in $r+b=200$, which yields $40+b=200$. Solving for b yields $b=160$. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they don't satisfy that Morgan biked for twice as many hours as she ran.

The given system of equations can be solved using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the second equation in the given system by $-2$ yields $-2ty = -1 -4x$, or $-1 -4x = -2ty$. Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system, $4x -6y = 10y + 2$, yields $(4x -6y) + (-1 -4x) = (10y +2) + (-2ty)$, or $-1 -6y = 10y -2ty +2$.

If the given system has no solution, then the equation $-1 -16y = -2ty +2$ has no solution. If this equation has no solution, the coefficients of $y$ on each side of the equation, $-16$ and $-2t$, must be equal, which yields the equation $-16 = -2t$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $-2$ yields $8 = t$. Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of $t$ is $8$. Alternate approach: A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the x-coefficients is equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the x-coefficients are not equal to the ratio of the constant terms. Subtracting $10y$ from both sides of the first equation in the given system yields $(4x -6y) - (10y) = (10y +2) - (10y)$, or $4x -16y =2$.

The y -intercept of the graph of $y = f(x) + 19$ is $(0,3)$. Translating the graph of $y = f(x) + 19$ down $19$ units results in a y -intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ at the point $(0, 3 - 19)$, or $(0,-16)$. The graph of $y = f(x) + 19$ slants down from left to right, so the slope of the graph is negative. The translation of a linear graph changes its position, but does not change its slope. It follows that the slope of the graph of $y = f(x)$ is also negative.

Let x represent the number of 2-person tents and let y represent the number of 4-person tents. It is given that the total number of tents was 60 and the total number of people in the group was 202. This situation can be expressed as a system of two equations, $x + y = 60$ and $2x + 4y = 202$ . The first equation can be rewritten as $y = -x + 60$ . Substituting $-x + 60$ for y in the equation $2x + 4y = 202$ yields $2x + 4 \\times (-x + 60) = 202$ . Distributing and combining like terms gives $-2x + 240 = 202$ . Subtracting 240 from both sides of $-2x + 240 = 202$ and then dividing both sides by $-2$ gives $x = 19$ . Therefore, the number of 2-person tents is 19.

A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct.

The given equation, $y=6x+18$, can be written in standard form by subtracting $6x$ from both sides of the equation to yield $-6x+y=18$. Therefore, the given equation can be written in the form $Ax + By = C$, where $A=-6$, $B=1$, and $C=18$.

Let $x$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the first piece, and let $y$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the second piece. It's given that the sample has a total mass of $50.0$ grams. Therefore, the equation $x+y=50.0$ represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is $50.0\\%$ silicon by mass. Therefore, the total mass of the silicon in the sample is $0.500(50.0)$, or $25.0$, grams. It's also given that the first piece was $30.0\\%$ silicon by mass and the second piece was $80.0\\%$ silicon by mass. Therefore, the masses, in grams, of the silicon in the first and second pieces can be represented by the expressions $0.300x$ and $0.800y$, respectively. Since the sample was created by combining the first and second pieces, and the total mass of the silicon in the sample is $25.0$ grams, the equation $0.300x+0.800y=25.0$ represents this situation. Subtracting $y$ from both sides of the equation $x+y=50.0$ yields $x=50.0 - y$. Substituting $50.0 - y$ for $x$ in the equation $0.300(50.0 - y)$ yields $0.300(50.0 - y) + 0.800y = 25.0$. Distributing $0.300$ on the left-hand side of this equation yields $15.0 - 0.300y + 0.800y = 25.0$. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields $15.0 + 0.500y = 25.0$. Subtracting $15.0$ from both sides of this equation yields $0.500y = 10.0$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $0.500$ yields $y = 20.0$. Substituting $20.0$ for $y$ in the expression representing the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the second piece, $0.800y$, yields $0.800(20.0)$, or $16.0$. Therefore, the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the second piece is $16.0$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the first piece, not the second piece.

If the owner pays $4.90$ per candle to purchase small candles and $11.\n60$ per candle to purchase large candles, what is the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase to stay within the budget and maintain the discounted pricing?", "Correct Answer": "182", "Rationale": "The correct answer is $182$. Let $s$ represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let $l$ represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It's given that the owner pays $4.90$ per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60$ per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays $4.90s$ dollars for $s$ small candles and $11.60 l$ dollars for $l$ large candles, which means the owner pays a total of $4.90s + 11.60 l$ dollars to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets $2,200$ to purchase candles. Therefore, $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$. It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of $200$ candles. Therefore, $s + l \\geq 200$. The inequalities $4.90s + 11.60 l \\leq 2,200$ and $s + l \\geq 200$ can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting $l$ from both sides of the inequality $s + l \\geq 200$ yields $s \\geq 200 - l$.

A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel.

The first equation in the given system, $\\frac{7}{8} y - \\frac{5}{8} x = \\frac{4}{7} - \\frac{7}{8} y$, can be written in standard form by adding $\\frac{7}{8} y$ to both sides of the equation, which yields $\\frac{14}{8} y - \\frac{5}{8} x = \\frac{4}{7}$, or $-\\frac{5}{8} x + \\frac{14}{8} y = \\frac{4}{7}$.

Let $x$ represent the number of children in a whale-watching tour group. Let $y$ represent the number of adults in this group. Because it's given that $21$ people are in a group and the group consists of adults and children, it must be true that $x + y = 21$. Since the company's revenue is $60x$ dollars per child, the total revenue from $x$ children in this group was $60x$ dollars. Since the company's revenue is $80y$ dollars per adult, the total revenue from $y$ adults in this group was $80y$ dollars.

Substituting $9$ for $h$ and $-14$ for $k$ in the equation $y = a (x - h)^2 + k$ gives $y = a (x - 9)^2 - 14$ , which can be rewritten as $y = a (x - 9)(x - 9) - 14$ , or $y = a (x^2 - 18 x + 81) - 14$ .

The mean of a data set is computed by dividing the sum of the values in the data set by the number of values in the data set.

This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{x}{75}=25$, where $x$ represents the sum of the heights of the objects, in meters, in data set A. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $75$ yields $x=75(25)$, or $x=1875$ meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the objects in data set A is $1875$ meters. It's also given that data set B consists of the heights of $50$ objects and has a mean of $65$ meters. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{y}{50}=65$, where $y$ represents the sum of the heights of the objects, in meters, in data set B. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $50$ yields $y=50(65)$, or $y=3250$ meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the objects in data set B is $3250$ meters. Since it's given that data set C consists of the heights of the $125$ objects from data sets A and B, it follows that the mean of data set C is the sum of the heights of the objects, in meters, in data sets A and B divided by the number of objects represented in data sets A and B, or $\\frac{1875+3250}{125}$, which is equivalent to $41$ meters.

If $f(-9)=f(3)$, then for the graph of $y=f(x)$, the point with an x-coordinate of $-9$ and the point with an x-coordinate of $3$ have the same y-coordinate. In the xy-plane, a parabola is a symmetric graph such that when two points have the same y-coordinate, these points are equidistant from the vertex, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinates of these two points.

The value that is halfway between $-9$ and $3$ is $\\frac{-9 + 3}{2}$, or $-3$. Therefore, $h=-3$. The equation defining $f$ can also be written in vertex form, $f(x)=a(x-h)^{2}+k$.

It's given that the side length of the larger square is $3$ times the side length of the smaller square. This means that the area of the larger square is $3^2$, or $9$, times the area of the smaller square. If the area of the smaller square is represented by $x$, then the area of the larger square can be represented by $9x$. Therefore, the flat surface of the two adjacent squares has a total area of $x + 9x$, or $10x$. It's given that an electric field with strength $29.00$ volts per meter passes uniformly through this surface and the total electric flux of the electric field through this surface is $4,640 \\text{ volts} \\cdot \\text{ meters}$. Since it's given that the electric flux is the product of the electric field's strength and the area of the surface, the equation $29.00 (10x) = 4,640$, or $290x=4,640$, can be used to represent this situation. Dividing each side of this equation by $290$ yields $x = 16$. Substituting $16$ for $x$ in the expression for the area of the larger square, $9x$, yields $9 (16)$, or $144$, square meters. Since the area of the larger square is $144$ square meters, the electric flux, in $\\text{volts} \\cdot \\text{ meters}$, of the electric field through the larger square can be determined by multiplying the area of the larger square by the strength of the electric field.

It's given that $f(0)=86$ and that for each increase in $x$ by $1$, the value of $f(x)$ decreases by $80\\%$. Because the output of the function decreases by a constant percentage for each $1$-unit increase in the value of $x$, this relationship can be represented by an exponential function of the form $f(x)=a(b)^x$, where $a$ represents the initial value of the function and $b$ represents the rate of decay, expressed as a decimal. Because $f(0)=86$, the value of $a$ must be $86$. Because the value of $f(x)$ decreases by $80\\%$ for each $1$-unit increase in $x$, the value of $b$ must be $(1-0.80)$, or $0.2$.

It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ , where $f(x)$ is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, $x$ seconds after the launch, $a$ is a constant, and $k$ is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached $h$ seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Therefore, $k=51.1$ and $h=3$ . Substituting $51.1$ for $k$ and $3$ for $h$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground. Therefore, when $x=0$ , $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $7$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = a(0 - 3)^2 + 51.1$ , or $7 = 9a + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = 9a$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $9$ yields $-4.9 = a$ . Substituting $-4.9$ for $a$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Therefore, the equation $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground $x$ seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters is the value of $x$ when $f(x) = 7$ . Substituting $7$ for $f(x)$ in $f(x) = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ yields $7 = -4.9(x - 3)^2 + 51.1$ . Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $-44.1 = -4.9(x - 3)^2$ . Dividing both sides of this equation by $-4.9$ yields $9 = (x - 3)^2$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: $3 = x - 3$ and $-3 = x - 3$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $3 = x - 3$ yields $6 = x$ . Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $-3 = x - 3$ yields $0 = x$ . Since $0$ seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, $6$ must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took $3$ seconds to travel from $7$ meters above the ground to its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take $3$ more seconds to travel from its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground back to $7$ meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters $3$ seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is $6$ seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect.

The opposite side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side across from the acute angle. It follows that the opposite side of angle $D$ is side $EF$. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. Therefore, $\\tan(D)=\\frac{EF}{DF}$. If $DF=125$, the length of side $EF$ can be found by substituting $\\sqrt{3}$ for $\\tan(D)$ and $125$ for $DF$ in the equation $\\tan(D)=\\frac{EF}{DF}$, which yields $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{EF}{125}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $125$ yields $125 \\sqrt{3} = EF$. Since the length of side $EF$ is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of side $DF$, it follows that triangle $DEF$ is a special right triangle with angle measures $30^{\\circ}$, $60^{\\circ}$, and $90^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse, $DE$, is $2$ times the length of side $DF$, or $DE=2(DF)$. Substituting $125$ for $DF$ in this equation yields $DE=2(125)$, or $DE=250$. Thus, if $\\tan(A)=\\sqrt{3}$ and $DF=125$, the length of $DE$ is $250$. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect. This is the length of $EF$, not $DE$.", "o1 (response)": "Because triangles ABC and DEF are similar with angles C and F right angles, and A corresponds to D, angle A has the same measure as angle D.

Since triangle $\\triangle ADE$ is a right triangle, it follows that $\\overline{AD}$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, $c$ , and $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ represent the lengths of the legs, $a$ and $b$ . Substituting $24$ for $b$ and $8 \\sqrt{34}$ for $c$ in the equation $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$ yields $a^{2} + (24)^{2} = (8 \\sqrt{34})^{2}$ , which is equivalent to $a^{2} + 576 = 64 (34)$ , or $a^{2} + 576 = 2176$ . Subtracting $576$ from both sides of this equation yields $a^{2} = 1600$ . Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $a = \\pm 40$ . Since $a$ represents a length, which must be positive, the value of $a$ is $40$ . Therefore, $\\overline{DE} = 40$ . Since $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ represent the lengths of the legs of triangle $\\triangle ADE$ , it follows that $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{AE}$ can be used to calculate the area, in square units, of the triangle as $\\frac{1}{2}(40)(24)$ , or $480$ . Therefore, the area, in square units, of triangle $\\triangle ADE$ is $480$.", "o1 (response)": "A concise way to see why the answer is 480 is via coordinates.  Place E at the origin, let A lie on the x\u2010axis, and let D lie on the y\u2010axis.  In particular, set  \n\u2022 E = (0,0),  \n\u2022 A = (a,0),  \n\u2022 D = (0,d).  \n\nSince \u2220DEA is the right angle, AE = a and DE = d are the legs of right triangle ADE, and its area will be (1/2)ad.\n\nNext, because C lies on AE, it has the form C = (c,0).  Because AC = 3, we get a \u2212 c = 3, so c = a \u2212 3.  \n\nBecause B lies on AD, any point on AD satisfies x/a + y/d = 1.

Substituting into x/a + y/d = 1 gives\n( (a \u2212 3) / a ) + ( b / d ) = 1  \u21d2  b/d = 3/a  \u21d2  b = 3d/a.\n\nWe are told AB = \u221a34.

Then d = (5/3)(24) = 40.  Thus, AE = 24 and DE = 40, so the area of triangle ADE is  \n(1/2) \u00d7 24 \u00d7 40 = 480.  \n\nTherefore, the required area is 480 square units.", "o1 (all_token_count)": 3539, "o1 (thinking_token_count)": 3008}

Since the first two terms of this expression have a common factor of $57x$ and the last two terms of this expression have a common factor of $a$, this expression can be rewritten as $57x (x + b) + a (x + b)$.

It's given that $\\sqrt{k - x} = 58 - x$. Squaring both sides of this equation yields $k - x = (58 - x)^2$, which is equivalent to the given equation if $58 - x > 0$. It follows that if a solution to the equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ satisfies $58 - x > 0$, then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation $k - x = (58 - x)^2$ can be rewritten as $k - x = 3,364 - 116x + x^2$. Adding $x$ to both sides of this equation yields $k = x^2 - 115x + 3,364$.

The slope of a line that passes through points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ can be calculated as $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Since the line of best fit shown for data set E passes approximately through the point $(12,30)$, it follows that a line of best fit for data set F passes approximately through the point $(12,30(3.9))$, or $(12,117)$. Substituting $(0,46.8)$ and $(12,117)$ for $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, respectively, in $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ yields $\\frac{117 - 46.8}{12 - 0}$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{70.2}{12}$, or $5.85$. Therefore, the value of $b$ is approximately $5.85$, or approximately $5.9$. Thus, $y = 46.8 + 5.9x$ could be an equation of a line of best fit for data set F.

Let x be the number of years after 1985. It follows that $\\frac{x}{2}$ represents the number of 2-year periods that will occur within an x-year period. According to Moore's law, every 2 years, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to double. Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double $\\frac{x}{2}$ \\times. Since the number of transistors included on a microprocessor was 275,000, or .275 million, in 1985, the estimated number of transistors, in millions, included x years after 1985 can be modeled as $0.275 \\times 2^{x/2}$. The year in which the number of transistors is estimated to be 1.1 million is represented by the value of x when $1.1 = 0.275 \\times 2^{x/2}$.

It's given that the graphs of the equations in the given system intersect at exactly one point, $( x, y )$, in the xy-plane. Therefore, $( x, y )$ is the only solution to the given system of equations. The given system of equations can be solved by subtracting the second equation, $y = 3x + a$, from the first equation, $y = 2x^2 - 21x + 64$. This yields $y - y = (2x^2 - 21x + 64) - (3x + a)$, or $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 - a$. Since the given system has only one solution, this equation has only one solution. A quadratic equation in the form $r x^2 + s x + t = 0$, where $r$, $s$, and $t$ are constants, has one solution if and only if the discriminant, $s^2 - 4 r t$, is equal to zero. Substituting $2$ for $r$, $-24$ for $s$, and $-a + 64$ for $t$ in the expression $s^2 - 4 r t$ yields $( -24 )^2 - (4) (2) (64 - a)$. Setting this expression equal to zero yields $( -24 )^2 - (4) (2) (64 - a) = 0$, or $8a + 64 = 0$. Subtracting $64$ from both sides of this equation yields $8a = -64$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $8$ yields $a = -8$. Substituting $-8$ for $a$ in the equation $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 - a$ yields $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 64 + 8$, or $0 = 2x^2 - 24x + 72$.

In this equation, $b$ represents the time, in seconds, at which the softball reaches its maximum height of $c$ meters above the ground. It's given that this softball reaches a maximum height of $51.84$ meters above the ground at $1.8$ seconds; therefore, $b = 1.8$ and $c = 51.84$.

It's given that the radius of the circle is $168$ millimeters. Since points $M$ and $N$ both lie on the circle, segments $GM$ and $GN$ are both radii. Therefore, segments $GM$ and $GN$ each have length $168$ millimeters. Two segments that are tangent to a circle and have a common exterior endpoint have equal length. Therefore, segment $MH$ and segment $NH$ have equal length. Let $x$ represent the length of segment $MH$. Then $x$ also represents the length of segment $NH$. It's given that the perimeter of quadrilateral $GMHN$ is $3856$ millimeters. Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral, $3856 = 168 + 168 + x + x$, or $3856 = 336 + 2x$. Subtracting $336$ from both sides of this equation yields $3520 = 2x$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $1760 = x$. Therefore, the length of segment $MH$ is $1760$ millimeters. A line segment that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Therefore, segment $GM$ is perpendicular to segment $MH$. Since perpendicular segments form right angles, angle $GMH$ is a right angle. Therefore, triangle $GMH$ is a right triangle with legs of length $1760$ millimeters and $168$ millimeters, and hypotenuse $GH$.

It's given that angle $J$ is the right angle in triangle $\\triangle JKL$ . Therefore, the acute angles of triangle $\\triangle JKL$ are angle $K$ and angle $L$ . The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite its right angle. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle $\\triangle JKL$ is side $\\overline{KL}$ . The cosine of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. It's given that $\\cos(K)=\\frac{24}{51}$ .

For quadratic relationships between $x$ and $y$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at the value of $x$ halfway between any two values of $x$ that have the same corresponding value of $y$. The table shows that x -values of $21$ and $25$ correspond to the same y -value, $-8$. Since $23$ is halfway between $21$ and $25$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at an x -value of $23$. The table shows that when $x = 23$, $y = 8$. It follows that $h = 23$ and $k + 4 = 8$. Subtracting $4$ from both sides of the equation $k + 4 = 8$ yields $k = 4$. Substituting $23$ for $h$ and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $y = a(x - h)^2 + k + 4$ yields $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 4 + 4$, or $y = a(x - 23)^2 + 8$. The value of $a$ can be found by substituting any x -value and its corresponding y -value for $x$ and $y$, respectively, in this equation. Substituting $25$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in this equation yields $-8 = (25 - 23)^2 + 8$, or $-8 = (2)^2 + 8$. Subtracting $8$ from both sides of this equation yields $-16 = (2)^2 a$, or $-16 = 4a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $-4 = a$. Substituting $-4$ for $a$, $23$ for $h$, and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = -4(x - 23)^2 + 4$. The y -intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the xy -plane is the point on the graph where $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation $f(x) = -4(x - 23)^2 + 4$ yields $f(0) = -4(0 - 23)^2 + 4$, or $f(0) = -4(-23)^2 + 4$. This is equivalent to $f(0) = -2112$, so the y -intercept of the graph of $y = f(x)$ in the xy -plane is $(0, -2112)$.

It's given that the dot plot represents a data set of the number of bursts for $13$ eruptions of a steam vent. The median of a data set with an odd number of elements is the middle element when the elements are in numerical order. For $13$ elements in numerical order, this is the $7th$ element. For this data set, the first $4$ elements have a value of $1$, and the next $5$ elements have a value of $2$. Thus, the $7th$ element in the ordered data set is $2$ and the median number of bursts for the original data set is $2$.

It's given that an exponential model estimates that the number of comments on an article increased by a fixed percentage at the end of each hour. Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form $C=K a^{t}$, where $C$ is the estimated number of comments on the article $t$ hours after the article was first featured on the home page and $K$ and $a$ are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were $40$ comments on the article. This means that when $t = 0$, $C = 40$. Substituting $0$ for $t$ and $40$ for $C$ in the equation $C=K a^{t}$ yields $40 = K a^{0}$, or $40 = K$. It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by $190\\%$ of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: $(40) (\\frac{190}{100})$, or $76$ comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is $40 + 76$, or $116$.

Let $x$ represent the first integer and $y$ represent the second integer. If the first integer is $5$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x=2y+5$. It's given that the product of the two integers is $462$ ; therefore $xy=462$. Substituting $2y+5$ for $x$ in this equation yields $(2y+5)(y)=462$, which can be written as $2y^2 + 5y = 462$. Subtracting $462$ from each side of this equation yields $2y^2 + 5y - 462 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2(-462)$, or $-924$, and whose sum is $5$. The two values whose product is $-924$ and whose sum is $5$ are $33$ and $-28$. Thus, the equation $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2y^2 - 28y + 33y - 462 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2y(y-14)+33(y-14) = 0$, or $(2y+33)(y-14) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2y + 33 = 0$ or $y - 14 = 0$. Subtracting $33$ from both sides of the equation $2y + 33 = 0$ yields $2y = -33$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $y = -\\frac{33}{2}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, the value of $y$ isn't $-\\frac{33}{2}$. Adding $14$ to both sides of the equation $y - 14 = 0$ yields $y = 14$. Substituting $14$ for $y$ in the equation $xy = 462$ yields $x(14)=462$.

The system of equations can be solved using the substitution method. Solving the second equation for $y$ gives $y = -x - 1$. Substituting the expression $-x - 1$ for $y$ into the first equation gives $-x - 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1$. Adding $x + 1$ to both sides of the equation yields $x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0$. The left-hand side of the equation can be factored by finding two numbers whose sum is $3$ and whose product is $2$, which gives $(x + 2)(x + 1) = 0$. Setting each factor equal to $0$ yields $x + 2 = 0$ and $x + 1 = 0$, and solving for $x$ yields $x = -2$ or $x = -1$.

The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points $(1,3)$ and $(9,10)$ in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, $m=\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 -x_1}$.

It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $f(x)$ is the height of the object $x$ seconds after it was launched, and $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, $k$, when $x = h$. Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of $1,034$ feet above the ground $8$ seconds after being launched, $f(x)$ reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = 8$. Therefore, $k = 1,034$ and $h = 8$. Substituting $8$ for $h$ and $1,034$ for $k$ in the function $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ yields $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$. Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of $10$ feet above the ground, the value of $f(x)$ is $10$ when $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f(x)$ in the equation $f(x) = a(x - 8)^2 + 1,034$ yields $10 = a(0 - 8)^2 + 1,034$, or $10 = 64a + 1,034$. Subtracting $1,034$ from both sides of this equation yields $64a = -1,024$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = -16$.

The mode is the data value with the highest frequency. So for the data shown, the mode is 18. The median is the middle data value when the data values are sorted from least to greatest. Since there are 20 ages ordered, the median is the average of the two middle values, the 10th and 11th, which for these data are both 19. Therefore, the median is 19. The mean is the sum of the data values divided by the number of the data values. So for these data, the mean is $\\frac{(18\\times 6) + (19\\times 5) + (20\\times 4) + (21\\times 2) + (22\\times 1) + (23\\times 1) + (30\\times1)}{20} = 20$.

Choice C is incorrect because the median is greater than the mode. Alternate approach: After determining the mode, 18, and the median, 19, it remains to determine whether the mean is less than 19 or more than 19. Because the mean is a balancing point, there is as much deviation below the mean as above the mean. It is possible to compare the data to 19 to determine the balance of deviation above and below the mean. There is a total deviation of only 6 below 19 (the 6 values of 18); however, the data value 30 alone deviates by 11 above 19. Thus the mean must be greater than 19.", "o1 (response)": "First, identify the mode:  \n\u2022 Age 18 appears 6 times (frequency = 6).  \n\u2022 Age 19 appears 5 times, age 20 appears 4 times, and all others appear fewer times.  \nThus, the mode is 18 (it has the highest frequency).\n\nNext, find the median. There are 20 students, so the median is the average of the 10th and 11th data values if all ages are listed in ascending order. Listing them:\n\n\u2022 18 appears 6 times \u21d2 positions 1 to 6  \n\u2022 19 appears 5 times \u21d2 positions 7 to 11  \n\u2022 20 appears 4 times \u21d2 positions 12 to 15  \n\u2022 21 appears 2 times \u21d2 positions 16 to 17  \n\u2022 22 appears 1 time  \u21d2 position 18  \n\u2022 23 appears 1 time  \u21d2 position 19  \n\u2022 30 appears 1 time  \u21d2 position 20  \n\nHence, the 10th data value is 19 and the 11th is also 19. So the median is (19 + 19)/2 = 19.\n\nFinally, compute the mean:  \nsum of all ages = (18\u00d76) + (19\u00d75) + (20\u00d74) + (21\u00d72) + (22\u00d71) + (23\u00d71) + (30\u00d71)  \n= 108 + 95 + 80 + 42 + 22 + 23 + 30  \n= 400  \n\nThe mean is 400 \u00f7 20 = 20.\n\nPutting these together: mode = 18, median = 19, mean = 20.

In the triangle shown, the hypotenuse has a length of $54$. It follows that $2 x = 54$, or $x = 27$. Therefore, the length of the leg opposite angle $B$ is $27$ and the length of the leg opposite angle $A$ is $27 \\sqrt{3}$. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. The length of the leg opposite angle $A$ is $27 \\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the leg adjacent to angle $A$ is $27$. Therefore, the value of $\\tan A$ is $\\frac{27 \\sqrt{3}}{27}$, or $\\sqrt{3}$. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect. This is the value of $\\frac{1}{\\tan A}$, not the value of $\\tan A$. Choice D is incorrect.

It's given that each vertex of the rectangle lies on the circumference of the circle. Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let $s$ represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it's given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, $2s$ represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Substituting $s$ for $a$ and $2s$ for $c$ in this equation yields $s^2 + b^2 = (2s)^2$, or $s^2 + b^2 = 4s^2$. Subtracting $s^2$ from both sides of this equation yields $b^2 = 3s^2$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields $b = s \\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the length, in units, of the rectangle's longest side is $s \\sqrt{3}$. The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the shortest side and the length of the longest side. The lengths, in units, of the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle are represented by $s$ and $s \\sqrt{3}$, and it's given that the area of the rectangle is $1089 \\sqrt{3}$ square units.

Since the graph passes through the point $(0, -6)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $0$, the value of $y$ is $-6$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $-6$ for $y$ in the given equation yields $-6=2(0)^2 + b(0)+c$, or $-6=c$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is $-6$. Substituting $-6$ for $c$ in the given equation yields $y=2x^2+bx-6$. Since the graph passes through the point $(-1,-8)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $-1$, the value of $y$ is $-8$. Substituting $-1$ for $x$ and $-8$ for $y$ in the equation $y=2x^2+bx-6$ yields $-8=2(-1)^2 + b(-1)-6$, or $-8=-4 - b$. Adding $4$ to each side of this equation yields $-4=-b$.

Alternate approach: The given equation represents a parabola in the xy-plane with a vertex at $(-1,-8)$. Therefore, the given equation, $y=2x^2+bx+c$, which is written in standard form, can be written in vertex form, $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex of the parabola and $a$ is the value of the coefficient on the $x^2$ term when the equation is written in standard form.

Squaring the binomial on the right-hand side of this equation yields $y=2(x^2+2x+1)-8$. Multiplying each term inside the parentheses on the right-hand side of this equation by $2$ yields $y=2x^2+4x+2-8$, which is equivalent to $y=2x^2+4x-6$.

Because segments OA and OB are radii of the circle centered at point O, these segments have equal lengths. Therefore, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle, where angles OAB and OBA are congruent base angles of the triangle. It's given that angle OAB measures $30\\circ$.
