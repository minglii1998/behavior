    "reason": "The paragraph employs straightforward reasoning to determine the perimeter of the rectangle using established formulas. It methodically calculates the sum of the rectangle's sides and provides reasoning for why each choice is correct or incorrect using problem data, without delving into exploration or verification stages.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice C is correct. The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. It's given that the rectangle has a length of $13$ and a width of $6$. It follows that the rectangle has two sides with length $13$ and two sides with length $6$. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is $13 + 13 + 6 + 6$, or $38$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the sum of the lengths of the two sides with length $6$, not the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle. Choice B is incorrect. This is the sum of the lengths of the two sides with length $13$, not the sum of the lengths of all four sides of the rectangle. Choice D is incorrect. This is the perimeter of a rectangle that has four sides with length $13$, not two sides with length $13$ and two sides with length $6$."
