    "reason": "The paragraph systematically explains the solution by presenting the known slope of line k and applying the property of parallel lines to find the slope of line j. It proceeds through logical reasoning to state the answer with confidence, without veering into exploratory or verification discussions.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "The correct answer is $\\frac{1}{4}$ . It's given that line $k$ is defined by $y=\\frac{1}{4}x+1$ . It's also given that line $j$ is parallel to line $k$ in the xy -plane. A line in the xy -plane represented by an equation in slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$ has a slope of $m$ and a y -intercept of $(0, b)$ . Therefore, the slope of line $k$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ . Since parallel lines have equal slopes, the slope of line $j$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ . Note that 1/4 and .25 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."
