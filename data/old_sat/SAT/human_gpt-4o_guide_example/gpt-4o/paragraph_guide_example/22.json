    "class": "General",
    "text": "The correct answer is $99$. In the given system of equations, the second equation is $x + 8 = 11$. Subtracting $8$ from both sides of this equation yields $x = 3$. In the given system of equations, the first equation is $y = x^2 + 14x + 48$. Substituting $3$ for $x$ in this equation yields $y = (3)^2 + 14 (3) + 48$, or $y = 99$. Therefore, the solution to the given system of equations is $( x, y ) = ( 3, 99 )$. Thus, the value of $y$ is $99$."
