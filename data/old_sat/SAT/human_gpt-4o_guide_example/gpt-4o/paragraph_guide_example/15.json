    "reason": "The paragraph progresses directly toward providing a solution to the problem by explaining the reasoning behind choosing Choice C as correct. It calculates the total cost using the given information and explains why other choices are incorrect based on conceptual errors.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice C is correct. It's given that this service contract requires a monthly cost of $23$ . A monthly cost of $23$ for $t$ months results in a cost of $23 t$ . It's also given that this service contract requires a onetime activation cost of $35$ . Adding the onetime activation cost to the monthly cost of the service contract for $t$ months yields the total cost $c$, in dollars, of this service contract for $t$ months. Therefore, this situation can be represented by the equation $c = 23 t + 35$ . Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."
