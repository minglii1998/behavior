    "reason": "The paragraph methodically applies the formula for the volume of a cylinder to find the height, states reasons why the other options are incorrect, and provides an explanation without exploring new methods or verifying correctness post-calculation. The reasoning is direct and structured.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice A is correct. The volume, $V$, of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$, where $\\pi r^2$ is the area of the base of the cylinder and $h$ is the height. It's given that a right circular cylinder has a volume of $432$ cubic centimeters and the area of the base is $24$ square centimeters. Substituting $432$ for $V$ and $24$ for $\\pi r^2$ in the formula $V = \\pi r^2 h$ yields $432 = 24 h$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $24$ yields $18 = h$. Therefore, the height of the cylinder, in centimeters, is $18$. Choice B is incorrect. This is the area of the base, in square centimeters, not the height, in centimeters, of the cylinder. Choice C is incorrect. This is the height, in centimeters, of a cylinder if its volume is $432$ cubic centimeters and the area of its base is $2$, not $24$, cubic centimeters. Choice D is incorrect. This is the height, in centimeters, of a cylinder if its volume is $432$ cubic centimeters and the area of its base is $\\frac{1}{24}$, not $24$, cubic centimeters."
