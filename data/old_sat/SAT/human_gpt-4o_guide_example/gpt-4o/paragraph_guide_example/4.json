    "reason": "The paragraph methodically applies the standard formula for the equation of a circle, substitutes given values, and evaluates options against the derived equation. It presents conclusions with certainty without revisiting or verifying the correctness of the answer once obtained.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice B is correct. An equation of a circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ , where the center of the circle is $(h, k)$ and the radius is r . It's given that the center of this circle is $(-8,6)$ and the radius is 5. Substituting these values into the equation gives $(x+8)^2 + (y-6)^2 = 5^2$ , or $(x+8)^2 + (y-6)^2 = 25$ . Choice A is incorrect. This is an equation of a circle that has center $(8,-6)$ . Choice C is incorrect. This is an equation of a circle that has center $(8,-6)$ and radius $\\sqrt{5}$ . Choice D is incorrect. This is an equation of a circle that has radius $\\sqrt{5}$ ."
