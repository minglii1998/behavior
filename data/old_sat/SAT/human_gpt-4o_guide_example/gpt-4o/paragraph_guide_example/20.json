    "reason": "The paragraph systematically progresses through solving the problem by deriving the necessary angles using known geometric properties, performing algebraic steps, and finally concluding with the correct solution to the problem. It confirms the calculations and describes why other options are incorrect, indicating that the entire reasoning is structured and planned toward arriving at the solution.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice D is correct. Since \\angle BCD and \\angle BCA form a linear pair of angles, their measures sum to 180$^{\\circ}$. It's given that the measure of \\angle BCD is 110$^{\\circ}$. Therefore, $110^{\\circ} + \\angle BCA = 180^{\\circ}$. Subtracting 110$^{\\circ}$ from both sides of this equation gives the measure of $\\angle BCA$ as 70$^{\\circ}$. It's also given that the measure of $\\angle BAC$ is equal to the measure of $\\angle BCA$. Thus, the measure of $\\angle BAC$ is also 70$^{\\circ}$. The measures of the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180$^{\\circ}$. Thus, $70^{\\circ} + 70^{\\circ} + x^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$. Combining like terms on the left-hand side of this equation yields $140^{\\circ} + x^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$. Subtracting 140$^{\\circ}$ from both sides of this equation yields $x^{\\circ} = 40^{\\circ}$, or $x = 40$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of the measure of $\\angle BCD$. Choice B is incorrect. This is the value of the measure of each of the other two interior angles, $\\angle BCA$ and $\\angle BAC$. Choice C is incorrect and may result from an error made when identifying the relationship between the exterior angle of a triangle and the interior angles of the triangle."
