    "reason": "The paragraph proceeds with a clear method by explaining how the solution to the system of equations corresponds to the intersection point and then applies this understanding directly to choose the correct answer, focusing on solving the problem using known information.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice A is correct. The solution to a system of equations is the coordinates of the intersection point of the graphs of the equations in the xy -plane. Based on the graph, the solution to the given system of equations is best approximated as $\\text{the point with coordinates } (\\frac{3}{2},0)$ . In the xy -plane, the graph of $y=0$ is a horizontal line on which every y -coordinate is 0, and the graph of $x=\\frac{3}{2}$ is a vertical line on which every x -coordinate is $\\frac{3}{2}$ . These graphs intersect at the point $\\text{with coordinates } (\\frac{3}{2},0)$ . Therefore, the system of equations in choice A has the same solution as the given system. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. If graphed in the xy -plane, these choices would intersect at the points $\\text{with coordinates } (0, \\frac{3}{2})$ , $1,0$, and $0,1$ , respectively, not $\\text{the point with coordinates } (\\frac{3}{2},0)$ ."
