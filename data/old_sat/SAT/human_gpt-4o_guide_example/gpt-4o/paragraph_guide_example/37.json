    "reason": "The paragraph systematically makes and supports the claim that Account A always earns more than Account B by calculating the earnings for the first year and explaining the impact of compound interest. It uses established methods and facts to make progress towards solving the problem, showing a clear and confident explanation without uncertainty or trial-and-error, which is characteristic of a General episode.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice A is correct. Account A starts with \\$500 and earns interest at 6\\% per year, so in the first year Account A earns (500)(0.06) = \\$30, which is greater than the \\$25 that Account B earns that year. Compounding interest can be modeled by an increasing exponential function, so each year Account A will earn more money than it did the previous year. Therefore, each year Account A earns at least \\$30 in interest. Since Account B always earns \\$25 each year, Account A always earns more money per year than Account B. Choices B and D are incorrect. Account A earns \\$30 in the first year, which is greater than the \\$25 Account B earns in the first year. Therefore, neither the statement that Account A always earns less money per year than Account B nor the statement that Account A earns less money than Account B at first can be true. Choice C is incorrect. Since compounding interest can be modeled by an increasing exponential function, each year Account A will earn more money than it did the previous year. Therefore, Account A always earns at least \\$30 per year, which is more than the \\$25 per year that Account B earns."
