    "reason": "The paragraph provides a clear and logical explanation for why Choice C is correct. It systematically interprets the median values from the box plots, applies the comparison, and concludes the correctness of Choice C. It then clarifies why each of the other choices, A, B, and D, is incorrect by addressing misunderstandings about the limitations of box plots concerning the mean. The demonstration of understanding concepts and application are characteristic of a General episode.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice C is correct. The median of a data set represented in a box plot is represented by the vertical line within the box. It follows that the median mass of the gazelles in group $1$ is $25$ kilograms, and the median mass of the gazelles in group $2$ is $24$ kilograms. Since $25$ kilograms is greater than $24$ kilograms, the median mass of group $1$ is greater than the median mass of group $2$. Choice A is incorrect. The mean mass of each of the two groups cannot be determined from the box plots. Choice B is incorrect. The mean mass of each of the two groups cannot be determined from the box plots. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."
