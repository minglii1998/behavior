    "reason": "The paragraph methodically explains the solution using established trigonometric principles, stating that the sine of any acute angle is equal to the cosine of its complement in a right triangle. It then directly applies this to find the value of cos(S). The paragraph confirms the answer choice by aligning it with this understanding and also explains why the other options are incorrect, without any speculative or uncertain exploration.",

    "text": "Choice B is correct. The sine of any acute angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. It's given that in right triangle $RST$ , the sum of the measures of angle $R$ and angle $S$ is $90$ degrees. Therefore, angle $R$ and angle $S$ are complementary, and the value of $\\sin R$ is equal to the value of $\\cos S$ . It's given that the value of $\\sin R$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}$ , so the value of $\\cos S$ is also $\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{4}$ . Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of $\\tan S$ . Choice C is incorrect. This is the value of $\\frac{1}{\\cos S}$ . Choice D is incorrect. This is the value of $\\frac{1}{\\tan S}$ ."
