    "reason": "The paragraph presents a direct solution to the problem by substituting a known value into an equation, and it explains the reasoning behind the correct and incorrect choices. This is a straightforward reasoning task without indications of exploration or verification.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice A is correct. The first equation in the given system of equations is $x=4$ . Substituting $4$ for $x$ in the second equation in the given system of equations yields $y=5 - 4$ , or $y=1$ . Choice B is incorrect. This is the value of $x$ in the solution to the given system of equations, not the value of $y$ . Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."
