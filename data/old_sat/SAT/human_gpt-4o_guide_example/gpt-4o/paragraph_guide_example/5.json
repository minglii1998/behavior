    "reason": "The paragraph methodically explains using the greatest common factor to factor out the expression and subsequently identifies the correct answer based on this calculation.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice D is correct. The expression $2x^{3} + 4$ has two terms, $2x^{3}$ and 4. The greatest common factor of these two terms is 2. Factoring 2 from each of these terms yields $2 \\times x^{3} + 2 \\times 2$, or $2 \\times (x^{3} + 2)$. Choices A and B are incorrect because 4 is not a factor of the term $2x^{3}$. Choice C is incorrect and may result from factoring 2 from $2x^{3}$ but not from 4."
