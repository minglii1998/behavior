    "reason": "The paragraph systematically analyzes the given equations to determine which one meets the specific condition of intersecting the y-axis at exactly one point. It applies the known formula for a circle, performs mathematical reasoning to derive the conditions needed (r = |h|), and checks each answer option accordingly. It encapsulates established knowledge and logic without trial-error method or verification of results.",

    "text": "Choice C is correct. The graph of the equation $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ in the xy -plane is a circle with center $(h,k)$ and a radius of length $r$. The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the xy -plane intersects the y -axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the y -axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius. It follows that the x -coordinate of the circle's center must be equivalent to the length of the circle's radius. In other words, if the graph of $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ is a circle that intersects the y -axis at exactly one point, then $r = \\left| h \\right|$ must be true. The equation in choice C is $(x-4)^2 + (y-9)^2 = 16$, or $(x-4)^2 + (y-9)^2 = 4^2$. This equation is in the form $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $h=4$, $k=9$, and $r=4$, and represents a circle in the xy -plane with center $(4,9)$ and radius of length $4$. Substituting $4$ for $r$ and $4$ for $h$ in the equation $r = \\left| h \\right|$ yields $4 = \\left|4\\right|$, or $4 = 4$, which is true. Therefore, the equation in choice C represents a circle in the xy -plane that intersects the y -axis at exactly one point. Choice A is incorrect. This is the equation of a circle that does not intersect the y -axis at any point. Choice B is incorrect. This is an equation of a circle that intersects the x -axis, not the y -axis, at exactly one point. Choice D is incorrect. This is the equation of a circle with the center located on the y -axis and thus intersects the y -axis at exactly two points, not exactly one point."
