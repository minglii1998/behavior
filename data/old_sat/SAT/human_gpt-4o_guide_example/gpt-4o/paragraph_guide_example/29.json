    "reason": "The paragraph logically and methodically computes the probability by systematically deriving the results using the information provided in the table. It presents the steps in calculating the number of participants in group A who are at least 10 years and sums the total number of participants who are at least 10 years. It then calculates the probability as a result and even provides alternate equivalent forms of the answer, showing confidence and clarity in the solution. This process involves direct progress toward solving the problem using known methods and established data without deviating into exploratory or verification steps.",

    "text": "The correct answer is $\\frac{23}{60}$ . It's given that one of the participants will be selected at random. The probability of selecting a participant from group A given that the participant is at least $10$ years of age is the number of participants in group A who are at least $10$ years of age divided by the total number of participants who are at least $10$ years of age. The table shows that in group A, there are $14$ participants who are $10$ - $19$ years of age and $9$ participants who are $20+$ years of age. Therefore, there are $14 + 9$ , or $23$ , participants in group A who are at least $10$ years of age. The table also shows that there are a total of $30$ participants who are $10$ - $19$ years of age and $30$ participants who are $20+$ years of age. Therefore, there are a total of $30 + 30$ , or $60$ , participants who are at least $10$ years of age. It follows that the probability of selecting a participant from group A given that the participant is at least $10$ years of age is $\\frac{23}{60}$ . Note that 23/60, .3833, and 0.383 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."
