    "reason": "The paragraph systematically carries out a sequence of solution steps to derive the expression for H in terms of D and T, starting from the given equation and applying algebraic transformations to solve for H. It is a clear application of known mathematical procedures without exploration or verification, thus it is a methodical progression towards the solution.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice A is correct. It's given that $D = T - \\frac{9}{25} \\times (100 - H)$ . Solving this formula for H expresses the relative humidity in terms of the temperature and the dew point. Subtracting T from both sides of this equation yields $D - T = -\\frac{9}{25} \\times (100 - H)$ . Multiplying both sides by $-\\frac{25}{9}$ yields $-\\frac{25}{9} \\times (D - T) = 100 - H$ . Subtracting 100 from both sides yields $-\\frac{25}{9} \\times (D - T) - 100 = -H$ . Multiplying both sides by $-1$ results in the formula $\\frac{25}{9} \\times (D - T) + 100 = H$ . Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may result from errors made when rewriting the given formula."
