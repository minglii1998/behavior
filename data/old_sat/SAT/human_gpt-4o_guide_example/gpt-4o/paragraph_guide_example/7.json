    "reason": "The paragraph methodically explains the reasoning behind the choice, primarily identifying why the non-random sampling in the poll fails to be representative of the U.S. population. It directly presents the established logic and analysis of the problem, focusing on a factual explanation rather than exploring new ideas or verifying.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice B is correct. In order for the poll results from a sample of a population to represent the entire population, the sample must be representative of the population. A sample that is randomly selected from a population is more likely than a sample of the type described to represent the population. In this case, the people who responded were people with access to cable television and websites, which aren't accessible to the entire population. Moreover, the people who responded also chose to watch the show and respond to the poll. The people who made these choices aren't representative of the entire population of the United States because they were not a random sample of the population of the United States. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they present reasons unrelated to whether the sample is representative of the population of the United States."
