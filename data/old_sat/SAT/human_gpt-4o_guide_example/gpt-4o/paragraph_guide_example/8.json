    "reason": "The paragraph directly evaluates the different options and their validity based on the survey sampling logic, applying known concepts systematically to reach a conclusion about the correct choice B. It lacks the exploratory tone or verification of a completed solution.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice B is correct. Selecting a sample of a reasonable size at random to use for a survey allows the results from that survey to be applied to the population from which the sample was selected, but not beyond this population. In this case, the population from which the sample was selected is all fourth-grade students at a certain school. Therefore, the results of the survey can be applied to all fourth-grade students at the school. Choice A is incorrect. The results of the survey can be applied to the 40 students who were surveyed. However, this isn't the largest group to which the results of the survey can be applied. Choices C and D are incorrect. Since the sample was selected at random from among the fourth-grade students at a certain school, the results of the survey can't be applied to other students at the school or to other fourth-grade students who weren't represented in the survey results. Students in other grades in the school or other fourth-grade students in the country may feel differently about announcements than the fourth-grade students at the school."
