    "reason": "The paragraph methodically applies known mathematical concepts like the zero product property and substitution, leading to a definitive result without showing uncertainty or verification examination.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "The correct answer is $336$. By the zero product property, if $(x+14)(t-x)=0$, then $x+14=0$, which gives $x=-14$, or $(t-x)=0$, which gives $x=t$. Therefore, $g(x)=0$ when $x=-14$ and when $x=t$. Since the graph of $y=g(x)$ passes through the point $(24,0)$, it follows that $g(24)=0$, so $t=24$. Substituting $24$ for $t$ in the equation $g(x)=(x+14)(t-x)$ yields $g(x)=(x+14)(24-x)$. The value of $g(0)$ can be calculated by substituting $0$ for $x$ in this equation, which yields $g(0)=(0+14)(24-0)$, or $g(0)=336$."
