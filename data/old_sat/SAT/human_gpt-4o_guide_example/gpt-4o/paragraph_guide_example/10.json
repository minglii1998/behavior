    "reason": "The paragraph methodically calculates the expected votes for Angel Cruz based on the poll data using proportional reasoning, explains the result, and examines options, all progressing the main solution without explicit checking or exploratory language.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice B is correct. It's given that $483$ out of $803$ voters responded that they would vote for Angel Cruz. Therefore, the proportion of voters from the poll who responded they would vote for Angel Cruz is $\\frac{483}{803}$. It's also given that there are a total of $6,424$ voters in the election. Therefore, the total number of people who would be expected to vote for Angel Cruz is $6,424 (\\frac{483}{803})$, or $3,864$. Since $3,864$ of the $6,424$ total voters would be expected to vote for Angel Cruz, it follows that $6,424 - 3,864$, or $2,560$ voters would be expected not to vote for Angel Cruz. The difference in the number of votes for and against Angel Cruz is $3,864 - 2,560$, or $1,304$ votes. Therefore, if $6,424$ people vote in the election, Angel Cruz would be expected to win by $1,304$ votes. Choice A is incorrect. This is the difference in the number of voters from the poll who responded that they would vote for and against Angel Cruz. Choice C is incorrect. This is the total number of people who would be expected to vote for Angel Cruz. Choice D is incorrect. This is the difference between the total number of people who vote in the election and the number of voters from the poll."
