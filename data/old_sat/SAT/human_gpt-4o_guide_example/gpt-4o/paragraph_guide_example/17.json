    "reason": "The paragraph systematically explains the reasoning process, applying each constraint given in the problem to identify the correct answer choice. The reasoning proceeds directly and methodically without veering into exploration or explicitly verifying a specific result, focusing on understanding and correctly interpreting each inequality based on the problem description.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice B is correct. Marisa will hire x junior directors and y senior directors. Since she needs to hire at least 10 staff members, $x + y \\geq 10$ . Each junior director will be paid \\$640 per week, and each senior director will be paid \\$880 per week. Marisa's budget for paying the new staff is no more than \\$9,700 per week; in terms of x and y , this condition is $640x + 880y \\leq 9700$. Since Marisa must hire at least 3 junior directors and at least 1 senior director, it follows that $x \\geq 3$ and $y \\geq 1$ . All four of these conditions are represented correctly in choice B. Choices A and C are incorrect. For example, the first condition, $640x + 880y \\geq 9700$ , in each of these options implies that Marisa can pay the new staff members more than her budget of \\$9,700. Choice D is incorrect because Marisa needs to hire at least 10 staff members, not at most 10 staff members, as the inequality $x + y \\leq 10$ implies."
