    "reason": "The paragraph methodically applies known techniques to solve the problem by transforming and solving equations. It presents the solution confidently and logically advances toward confirming the value of 8/x. Various methods are provided, including using alternate expressions, but all are steps within a structured solution plan without any detours or verification effort.",

    "text": "The correct answer is $\\frac{1}{5}$ . Since the number $5$ can also be written as $\\frac{5}{1}$ , the given equation can also be written as $\\frac{x}{8}=\\frac{5}{1}$ . This equation is equivalent to $\\frac{8}{x}=\\frac{1}{5}$ . Therefore, the value of $\\frac{8}{x}$ is $\\frac{1}{5}$ . Note that 1/5 and .2 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer. Alternate approach: Multiplying both sides of the equation $\\frac{x}{8}=5$ by $8$ yields $x=40$ . Substituting $40$ for $x$ into the expression $\\frac{8}{x}$ yields $\\frac{8}{40}$ , or $\\frac{1}{5}$ ."
