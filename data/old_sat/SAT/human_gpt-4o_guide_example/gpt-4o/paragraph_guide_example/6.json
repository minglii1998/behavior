    "reason": "The paragraph systematically explains the process of expanding and simplifying the given expression using known mathematical properties and operations. The rationale for each step is provided, clearly following a planned approach without diverging into exploration or verification.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice D is correct. Expanding the given expression using the distributive property yields $2a^{2} \\cdot a + 2a^{2} \\cdot 3$ . Combining like terms yields $2a^{2} \\cdot (a^{1}) + (2 \\times 3) \\cdot (a^{2})$ , or $2a^{2+1} + 6a^{2}$ , which is equivalent to $2a^{3} + 6a^{2}$ . Choices A and B are incorrect and may result from incorrectly combining like terms. Choice C is incorrect and may result from distributing $2a^{2}$ only to a , and not to 3, in the given expression."
