    "reason": "The paragraph proceeds directly with solving the problem by substituting into the given function, solving for x, and eliminating incorrect choices. There is no indication of exploratory or verification processes\u2014it is a straightforward application of algebra.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice A is correct. It's given that $g(x) = x^{2} + 9$ . Substituting $25$ for $g(x)$ in this equation yields $25 = x^{2} + 9$ . Subtracting $9$ from both sides of this equation yields $16 = x^{2}$ . Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields $x = \\pm 4$ . It follows that $g(x) = 25$ when the value of $x$ is $4$ or $-4$ . Only $4$ is listed among the choices. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."
