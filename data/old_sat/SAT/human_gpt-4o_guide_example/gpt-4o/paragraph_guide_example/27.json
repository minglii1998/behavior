    "text": "The correct answer is $56$. It's given that Cedric had $35$ plants in his garden last year and that the number of plants in Cedric's garden this year is $60\\%$ greater than the number of plants in his garden last year. It follows that the number of plants in Cedric's garden this year is $35$ plus $60\\%$ of $35$, which is equal to $35 + 35(\\frac{60}{100})$, or $35 + 35(0.6)$. This expression is equivalent to $35 + 21$, or $56$. Therefore, Cedric has $56$ plants in his garden this year."
