    "reason": "The paragraph presents a definitive answer supported by logical reasoning, stating that approximately 30% of largemouth bass weigh more than 2 pounds. It rejects options A, B, and C based on the data given, indicating a direct application of the sample's results to conclude about the population, which is characteristic of a General episode.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Choice D is correct. The sample of 150 largemouth bass was selected at random from all the largemouth bass in the pond, and since 30\\% of the fish in the sample weighed more than 2 pounds, it can be concluded that approximately 30\\% of all largemouth bass in the pond weigh more than 2 pounds. Choices A, B, and C are incorrect. Since the sample contained 150 largemouth bass, of which 30\\% weighed more than 2 pounds, this result can be generalized only to largemouth bass in the pond, not to all fish in the pond."
