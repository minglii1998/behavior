    "text": "Okay, let's see. Vivian bought party hats and cupcakes for a total of $71. Each package of party hats costs $3, and each cupcake costs $1. The question says she bought 10 packages of party hats, and we need to find out how many cupcakes she bought. Alright, let's break this down."

    "reason": "The paragraph performs the first calculation: finding the cost of party hats using the relevant operation and given values.",
    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "First, let's figure out how much money she spent on party hats. Each package is $3, and she bought 10 packages. So, 10 packages multiplied by $3 per package. Let me write that out: 10 * 3 = $30. So, she spent $30 on party hats."

    "reason": "This paragraph determines the cost of cupcakes by subtracting the already calculated cost of party hats from the total. It continues the process of analyzing the problem situation.",
    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "Now, the total amount she spent was $71. If she spent $30 on party hats, then the remaining money must have been spent on cupcakes. To find out how much she spent on cupcakes, we can subtract the cost of the party hats from the total amount. That would be $71 - $30. Let me do that calculation: 71 - 30 = $41. So, she spent $41 on cupcakes."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Each cupcake costs $1, right? So, if each cupcake is $1, then the number of cupcakes she bought would be equal to the amount she spent on cupcakes. Since she spent $41 on cupcakes, that must mean she bought 41 cupcakes. Let me confirm that. If each cupcake is $1, then 41 cupcakes would cost 41 * 1 = $41, which matches the remaining money after buying the party hats."

    "text": "Let me define variables. Let p be the number of party hat packages, and c be the number of cupcakes. The total cost is given by 3p + 1c = 71. The problem states that p = 10, so substituting that into the equation: 3*10 + c = 71. That simplifies to 30 + c = 71. Subtracting 30 from both sides: c = 71 - 30 = 41. So, c = 41. Therefore, Vivian bought 41 cupcakes."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Okay, both methods give me the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 41 is the correct number. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't overlook anything. The problem mentions party hats and cupcakes, with given prices. Total spent is $71. Given that 10 party hat packages were bought, each at $3, so total for hats is 10*3=30. Total minus hats gives cupcakes' total cost, which is 71-30=41. Since each cupcake is $1, number of cupcakes is 41. All steps make sense, and the calculations check out. "

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "No, wait, another thought. Could there be tax or something else added? The problem doesn't mention any tax, so we can assume all amounts are pre-tax, or tax is included in the given prices. Since the problem states each package of party hats is $3 and each cupcake is $1, and the total is $71, we can safely ignore taxes unless mentioned, which they aren't. So, no need to consider that."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Is there a possibility of a discount for buying in bulk? The problem doesn't state any discounts, so I think we can assume each item is at the listed price. Therefore, the total cost is simply the sum of the individual items."
