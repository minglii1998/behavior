    "text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about 10 students selling a total of 90 boxes of cookies. They're asking which of the given choices can be calculated from this information. The options are A) average, B) median, C) greatest number, and D) least number."

  {
    "reason": "The paragraph applies the formula for average, connects known quantities, and processes which choices might be answerable. It performs a calculation directly from the provided data.",
    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. The average, or mean, is the total divided by the number of students. Since we know the total is 90 boxes and there are 10 students, that should be straightforward. So average would be 90 divided by 10, which is 9. So A) seems possible. But let's check the others."
  },
  {
    "reason": "The paragraph investigates the requirements for finding the median, considers possible distributions, and reasons why it cannot be determined with given information.",
    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For 10 students, the median would be the average of the 5th and 6th values. However, to find the median, we need to know the individual values or at least their distribution. But here we just have the total. So if all we know is the total, we can't determine the median because there are many different distributions that could add up to 90. For example, maybe all students sold exactly 9 boxes, making the median 9. Or maybe some sold more and some sold less. The median could vary. So B) probably can't be calculated."
  },
  {
    "reason": "The paragraph explores possible scenarios for the maximum value, testing the limits based on the given total, and demonstrates that insufficient information prevents calculation.",
    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "C) The greatest number of boxes sold by one student. Hmm. Without knowing the distribution, can we determine the maximum? Well, the maximum could be as high as 90 if one student sold all 90, and the rest sold 0. But that's an extreme case. Alternatively, if the maximum was lower, like 50, then the others would have to add up to 40. But there's no way to know for sure just from the total. So we can't determine the maximum; it could be any number from 9 up to 90, depending on how the boxes are distributed. So C) can't be calculated."
  },
  {
    "reason": "The paragraph explores the minimum's possible values using logical reasoning about distributions, similarly concluding that the minimum cannot be calculated.",
    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "D) The least number of boxes sold by one student. Similar to the maximum, the minimum could be 0 if one student didn't sell any, and the others sold more. Or it could be 9 if everyone sold exactly 9. But again, without specific data, we can't determine the minimum. So D) is out."
  },
  {
    "reason": "The paragraph evaluates which answer choices can be calculated, checks the computation for A by dividing total by the number of students, and confirms other options require unavailable information. This involves considering possible solution paths and justification.",
    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "So the only one that can be calculated is A) the average. Let me double-check. The average is total divided by number of students, which is given. So 90/10 = 9. So yes, A) is possible. The rest require more information about individual sales, which we don't have. So the answer must be A.</think>The average number of boxes sold per student can be calculated using the total boxes (90) and the number of students (10). The average is \\( \\frac{90}{10} = 9 \\). "
