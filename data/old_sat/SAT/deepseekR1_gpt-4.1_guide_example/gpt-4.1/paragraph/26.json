Wait, actually, the box is shorter on the right side of the median. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. The distance from Q1 to median is 3, and from median to Q3 is 1. That suggests that the data between Q1 and median is more spread out, which might indicate left skew? Wait, no. Skewness direction is a bit counterintuitive.
