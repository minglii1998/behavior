    "text": "Okay, so I need to find the probability of selecting a participant from group A, given that the participant is at least 10 years old. Hmm, let me remember how conditional probability works. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). Right, so in this case, event A is selecting someone from group A, and event B is selecting someone who is at least 10 years old. So I need to find the probability that someone is in group A and at least 10 years old, divided by the probability that someone is at least 10 years old."

So the participants who are at least 10 years old would be in the 10-19 and 20+ columns. Let me check the totals for those columns. The total for 10-19 years is 30, and the total for 20+ years is also 30. So adding those together, there are 30 + 30 = 60 participants who are at least 10 years old. So P(B) is 60/90, which simplifies to 2/3."

So adding those together: 14 + 9 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 participants who are in group A and at least 10 years old. So P(A and B) is 23/90."

So as a decimal, 23 divided by 60 is approximately 0.3833..., but the question says to express as a decimal or fraction. Since 23 and 60 don't have common factors (23 is a prime number, and 60 is 2*2*3*5), the fraction 23/60 is already in simplest form. So I should present that as the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any numbers from the table. Let me check group B and C too, but no, the question is about group A. So yes, 23 in group A and at least 10, total 60 in that age range. Therefore, 23/60 is correct. Alright, that seems right."
