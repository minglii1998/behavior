There are 40 fourth-grade students randomly selected from a certain school. They completed a survey about the morning announcements, and 32 of them thought the announcements were helpful. The question is asking which of the given options is the largest population this survey result can be generalized to."

When you conduct a survey, the sample should be representative of the population you want to generalize the results to. The key here is that the sample was selected randomly from a specific population. If the sample is random and there's no bias in the selection process, then the results can be generalized to the population from which the sample was drawn."

So unless there's a reason to believe that other grades have similar opinions, which we don't know, this might be overreaching.

Counties can have multiple schools with different demographics, so unless there's a random sample from all schools in the county, this might not hold."

Option D is a larger geographical area, but we don't know if the school is representative of the county. Option A is just the sample itself, which is too small.

Since the sample is representative of the fourth-grade population at that school, the results can be generalized to **all fourth-grade students at the school**.
