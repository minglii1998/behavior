    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "First, let's break down the costs. The activation fee is a one-time charge, which means no matter how many months you use the service, you only pay that $35 once. So that part of the cost isn't going to change based on the number of months. Then, there's a monthly cost of $23. That means every month, you have to pay $23, so if you have t months, you'd have to multiply 23 by t to get the total monthly cost over that period."

    "text": "Option A: c = t/23 + 35. That would mean the more months you have, the less you pay each month? That doesn't make sense because the problem says it's a monthly cost, so multiplying, not dividing. So A is probably wrong."

The activation fee is a one-time $35, so that should be the constant term, not multiplied by t. The monthly cost is $23, so that should be multiplied by t. So D is incorrect because it swaps the coefficients."

If I plug t = 1 into option C, c = 23*1 + 35 = 58, which matches. If I use option D, it would be 35*1 + 23 = $58 as well. Wait, hold on. Both C and D give the same result when t=1? Hmm, maybe I need to check with another number. Let's try t = 2."

    "text": "For t = 2 months, the correct cost should be 35 + 23*2 = 35 + 46 = $81. Now, plugging into option C: 23*2 + 35 = 46 + 35 = 81. That's correct. Option D: 35*2 + 23 = 70 + 23 = 93. Which is different. So when t is 2, option D gives a higher cost. Therefore, D is wrong. So my initial thought was right. C is the correct answer."

Here, the fixed cost is the one-time activation fee of $35, so that's the constant term. The variable cost is $23 per month, so that's the coefficient of t. So the equation should be c = 23t + 35, which is option C. Yep, that makes sense. So I'm confident that C is the right answer."
