Bring down the next 0, making it 60. 14 goes into 60 four times (14*4=56), subtract 56 from 60, get 4. Bring down the next 0, making it 40. 14 goes into 40 twice (14*2=28), subtract 28 from 40, get 12. Bring down the next 0, making it 120. 14 goes into 120 eight times (14*8=112), subtract 112 from 120, get 8.

However, the problem just says to express it as a decimal or fraction. Since 1/14 is exact, and the decimal is repeating, maybe it's better to leave it as a fraction unless specified otherwise.

The problem just states that each vertex is labeled with a different letter from A to N. So, no particular arrangement is specified. Since the letters are assigned randomly, each letter is equally likely to be on any vertex. Therefore, even if the letters were arranged in some specific order, the probability remains 1/14 because the selection is random. The key here is that the selection is of a vertex, not a letter.
