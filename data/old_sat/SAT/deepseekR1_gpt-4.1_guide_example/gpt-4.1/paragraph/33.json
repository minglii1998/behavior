Let me get a better estimate. Let's see, 7.5 squared is 56.25, right? Because 7 times 7 is 49, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and the cross term is 2*7*0.5 = 7. So, 49 + 7 + 0.25 = 56.25. Hmm, so 7.5 squared is 56.25. But we need 58. So, 58 is 1.75 more than 56.25. Let's try 7.6 squared."

That's really close to 58. So, 58 minus 57.76 is 0.24. So, the square of 7.6 is 57.76, which is 0.24 less than 58. So, how much more do we need to add to 7.6 to get to 58?"

So, 57.76 + 15.2d \u2248 58. So, 15.2d \u2248 0.24. Therefore, d \u2248 0.24 / 15.2 \u2248 0.0157. So, approximately 0.016. Therefore, the square root of 58 is approximately 7.6 + 0.016 = 7.616.

Since 58 is closer to 57.76 (difference of 0.24) than to 59.29 (difference of 1.29), so yes, 7.6 is the closest. Therefore, answer C."

So, Pythagoras is definitely the way to go here. The answer choices also include 20, which is way too big, because even if both legs were 10, the hypotenuse would be about 14.14. So 20 is too much. 5 is less than 7, which is one of the legs, but hypotenuse has to be longer than either leg. So 5 is too small. 3.2 is way too small. So, only reasonable options are C) 7.6 and maybe B)5. But 5 is too small, so C is the answer."
