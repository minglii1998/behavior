So, basically, I have to solve the equation x\u00b2 + 9 = 25. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me write that down step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes."

    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "First, the equation is x\u00b2 + 9 = 25. To solve for x, I should isolate x. So, subtract 9 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left. That would give me x\u00b2 = 25 - 9. Let me compute 25 minus 9. 25 minus 10 is 15, so 25 minus 9 is 16. So now, the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 = 16."

I wonder why they didn't include -4 as an option. Maybe the problem is set in a context where negative numbers aren't considered, or maybe they're testing if students recognize that even though there are two mathematical solutions, only the positive one is among the choices. Either way, 4 is the right answer here."
