    "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these equations represents a circle that intersects the y-axis at exactly one point. Hmm, intersecting the y-axis at exactly one point means that the circle is tangent to the y-axis, right? Because if it intersects at two points, it's passing through the y-axis, and if it doesn't intersect, it's either to the left or right without touching. But tangent would mean just touching at one point. So, how do I determine if a circle is tangent to the y-axis?"

So, for the circle to be tangent to the y-axis, the distance from the center of the circle to the y-axis (which is |h|, since the y-axis is x=0) must be equal to the radius. Because if the distance from the center to the y-axis is exactly the radius, then the circle touches the y-axis at exactly one point. So, the condition is |h| = r."
