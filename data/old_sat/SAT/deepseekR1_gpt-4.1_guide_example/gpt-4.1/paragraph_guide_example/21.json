If T is the temperature, then subtracting (9/25)(100 - H) from T would give a lower value D. Let me see: If H is 100%, then (100 - H) would be 0, so D = T, which makes sense because when relative humidity is 100%, the dew point equals the temperature. If H is lower, then (100 - H) is positive, so D would be less than T. That makes sense. So maybe the original formula was meant to be D = T - (9/25)(100 - H). But in the problem, it's written as D = (9/25)(100 - H). Hmm. That discrepancy is a problem. Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, but given that the user has provided the formula as D = (9/25)(100 - H), I have to work with that. However, then the mention of temperature T is confusing. Wait, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a different relation. Wait, maybe the formula is D = (9/25)(T - (100 - H))? Let's try that. If so, then D = (9/25)(T - 100 + H). Then solving for H would involve rearranging. But without knowing T's relation, maybe that's possible. Wait, but given that the problem states that the formula is D = (9/25)(100 - H), then perhaps the formula is correct as given, but the mention of temperature T is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the temperature T is 100\u00b0F? That seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps the problem is from a specific source where they assume a fixed temperature, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the answer choices are in terms of T even though the original formula does not include T, which would mean that there's an error.
