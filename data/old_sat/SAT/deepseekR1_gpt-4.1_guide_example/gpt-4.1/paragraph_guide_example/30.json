    "text": "Since it's a 14-sided polygon, there are 14 vertices in total. Each vertex has a unique letter from A to N, which are 14 letters. So, each letter is used exactly once.

Bring down the next 0, making it 20. 14 goes into 20 once (14*1=14), subtract 14 from 20, we get 6. Bring down the next 0, making it 60. 14 goes into 60 four times (14*4=56), subtract 56 from 60, get 4. Bring down the next 0, making it 40. 14 goes into 40 twice (14*2=28), subtract 28 from 40, get 12. Bring down the next 0, making it 120. 14 goes into 120 eight times (14*8=112), subtract 112 from 120, get 8. Bring down the next 0, making it 80. 14 goes into 80 five times (14*5=70), subtract 70 from 80, get 10. Now we see that 10 was a remainder earlier, so the pattern will start repeating."

However, the problem just says to express it as a decimal or fraction. Since 1/14 is exact, and the decimal is repeating, maybe it's better to leave it as a fraction unless specified otherwise. The question doesn't specify how many decimal places, so probably safest to go with the fraction."

Since the selection is random, each vertex has an equal probability of being chosen. Therefore, the probability that the selected vertex is the one labeled D is indeed 1 out of 14. That seems straightforward."

The problem just states that each vertex is labeled with a different letter from A to N. So, no particular arrangement is specified. Since the letters are assigned randomly, each letter is equally likely to be on any vertex. Therefore, even if the letters were arranged in some specific order, the probability remains 1/14 because the selection is random. The key here is that the selection is of a vertex, not a letter. But since each letter is on exactly one vertex, the probability of selecting the vertex with D is 1/14."

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the probability of selecting the letter D regardless of the vertex, that might be different, but in this case, it's specifically about selecting a vertex and checking if it's labeled D. So, yes, 1/14 is correct."

    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Suppose instead of 14 sides, it was a 3-sided polygon (triangle) labeled A, B, C. The probability of selecting a vertex labeled B would be 1/3. Similarly, scaling up, with 14 sides, it's 1/14. So, the size of the polygon doesn't change the basic principle here. Each label is unique, so one out of the total number."
