    "class": "General",

So, a\u00b2 times a is a^(2+1) which is a\u00b3. Then, multiplying by the coefficient 2, so 2 * 1 (since the coefficient of 'a' is 1) is 2. So, that term becomes 2a\u00b3."

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Now the second term inside the parentheses is 3. Multiplying 2a\u00b2 by 3. That should be straightforward: 2 * 3 is 6, and then you still have the a\u00b2 term. So, that term becomes 6a\u00b2."
