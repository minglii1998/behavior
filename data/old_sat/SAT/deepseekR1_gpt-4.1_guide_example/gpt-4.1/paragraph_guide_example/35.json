Or maybe someone thought that the system is y = 5 - x and x = 4, but solved incorrectly? For example, if someone subtracted 5 - x as 5 - 4 = 1, that's correct. If someone thought it's 5 + 4, that would be 9, which is option D, but that would be a mistake in the sign. So maybe option D is a trap for people who add instead of subtract. But since the equation is y = 5 - x, subtraction is the right operation."

Therefore, it is supporting the main answer rather than testing it or exploring alternative solution paths.",

    "text": "Alternatively, if someone confused the value of x with y, they might think y is 4, which is option B, but that's not correct because y is calculated as 5 - x.
