    "text": "First, the equation is x\u00b2 + 9 = 25. To solve for x, I should isolate x. So, subtract 9 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left. That would give me x\u00b2 = 25 - 9. Let me compute 25 minus 9. 25 minus 10 is 15, so 25 minus 9 is 16. So now, the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 = 16."

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Next, to solve for x, I need to take the square root of both sides. Remember, when you take the square root of both sides, you have to consider both the positive and negative roots.

    "class": "General",
    "text": "But hold on, the original equation x\u00b2 + 9 = 25 does have two solutions: 4 and -4. But since the answer choices only include 4, that's the one we go with. I wonder why they didn't include -4 as an option. Maybe the problem is set in a context where negative numbers aren't considered, or maybe they're testing if students recognize that even though there are two mathematical solutions, only the positive one is among the choices. Either way, 4 is the right answer here."
