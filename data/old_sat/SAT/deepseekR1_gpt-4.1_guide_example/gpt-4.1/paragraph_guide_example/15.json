    "reason": "This paragraph methodically explains the relationship of each cost to the variables in the problem and sets up the logic of how to express total cost. It is a direct, planned advance toward the answer, not an exploration or a verification.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "First, let's break down the costs. The activation fee is a one-time charge, which means no matter how many months you use the service, you only pay that $35 once. So that part of the cost isn't going to change based on the number of months. Then, there's a monthly cost of $23. That means every month, you have to pay $23, so if you have t months, you'd have to multiply 23 by t to get the total monthly cost over that period."

    "reason": "The paragraph synthesizes the cost components into an explicit equation, lays out the structure of the answer, and states the formula to be matched to the choices. It is continuing a clear, expository solution path.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "So putting that together, the total cost c should be the sum of the one-time activation fee and the monthly costs. So that would be c equals the activation fee plus the monthly rate times the number of months. In numbers, that would be c = 35 + 23t. Let me check the answer choices."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Option C is c = 23t + 35. That's the same as what I just wrote, just written in a different order because addition is commutative. So 35 + 23t is the same as 23t + 35. So that's probably the right answer. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something."

    "text": "Option A: c = t/23 + 35. That would mean the more months you have, the less you pay each month? That doesn't make sense because the problem says it's a monthly cost, so multiplying, not dividing. So A is probably wrong."

    "text": "Option B: c = t/35 + 23. Similarly, dividing the number of months by 35 and then adding 23. Again, the monthly cost should be multiplied by the number of months, not divided. So B is out."

The activation fee is a one-time $35, so that should be the constant term, not multiplied by t. The monthly cost is $23, so that should be multiplied by t. So D is incorrect because it swaps the coefficients."

    "reason": "Here the solver shifts from elimination to checking the suspected correct answer with a concrete value (t=1)\u2014explicitly plugging in numbers as a check and reflecting on whether the answers match. There is a clear verification routine as they test the solution.",
    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Therefore, the correct answer must be C. Let me just verify once more. If I have, say, t = 1 month, then the total cost should be 35 + 23*1 = $58. If I plug t = 1 into option C, c = 23*1 + 35 = 58, which matches. If I use option D, it would be 35*1 + 23 = $58 as well. Wait, hold on. Both C and D give the same result when t=1? Hmm, maybe I need to check with another number. Let's try t = 2."

  {
    "reason": "Continues the verification process by checking with t=2 and comparing the outputs for options C and D, confirming that only C consistently yields the correct cost. The explicit purpose is to validate the answer.",
    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "For t = 2 months, the correct cost should be 35 + 23*2 = 35 + 46 = $81. Now, plugging into option C: 23*2 + 35 = 46 + 35 = 81. That's correct. Option D: 35*2 + 23 = 70 + 23 = 93. Which is different. So when t is 2, option D gives a higher cost. Therefore, D is wrong. So my initial thought was right. C is the correct answer."

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Just to make sure, let's think about how these equations work. A linear equation for total cost usually has a fixed cost (the y-intercept) and a variable cost (the slope). Here, the fixed cost is the one-time activation fee of $35, so that's the constant term. The variable cost is $23 per month, so that's the coefficient of t. So the equation should be c = 23t + 35, which is option C. Yep, that makes sense. So I'm confident that C is the right answer."
