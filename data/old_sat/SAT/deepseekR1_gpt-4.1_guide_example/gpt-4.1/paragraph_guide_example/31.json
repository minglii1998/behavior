The land area stayed the same at 100,250 square kilometers. We need to find out how many more people there were in 2014 compared to 1990.

Breaking that down: 100,250 \u00d7 2 = 200,500, and then 100,250 \u00d7 0.5 = 50,125. Adding those together gives 200,500 + 50,125 = 250,625. So the population in 1990 was 250,625 people."

Subtract the thousands first: 330,000 - 250,000 = 80,000. Then subtract the remaining 625: 825 - 625 = 200. So 80,000 + 200 = 80,200. So the population increased by 80,200 people."
