Since it burns 1 ounce every 4 hours, in 44 hours, how many ounces would that be? 44 divided by 4 is 11. So 11 ounces burned. 17 minus 11 is 6 ounces remaining. Yep, that matches the problem statement. So it's definitely 44 hours. So the answer is D."

    "text": "But just to be thorough, let me consider the other options. If someone thought that it's 6 ounces burned instead of 11, they might do 6 times 4, which is 24. But that's not right because the remaining wax is 6, so the burned wax is 17 - 6 = 11. So 11 ounces burned. 11 times 4 is 44. So D is correct. The other options don't make sense. 3 hours would be less than an ounce burned, 6 hours would be 1.5 ounces, which isn't 11. 24 is 6 ounces burned, which again is incorrect. So yeah, D is the right answer."
