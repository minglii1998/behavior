First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The function is a quadratic in terms of x, and there's a constant t involved. The graph of this function goes through the specific point (24, 0), which means when x is 24, y is 0. I need to figure out the value of t first, probably, and then plug in x = 0 into the function to find g(0). "

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Alright, step by step. Since the graph passes through (24, 0), substituting x = 24 into g(x) should give 0. Let me write that out. So, g(24) = (24 + 14)(t - 24) = 0. Let me compute that. 24 + 14 is 38, so 38 times (t - 24) equals 0. So, 38*(t - 24) = 0. Hmm, solving for t here. Since 38 isn't zero, the other factor must be zero. Therefore, t - 24 = 0, which implies t = 24. Oh, so t is 24? Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check that again. If I plug x = 24 into g(x), then (24 + 14)(t - 24) = 38*(t - 24). Since the result is 0, t must be 24. Yep, that makes sense. "

So, g(0) = (0 + 14)(24 - 0) = 14 * 24. Now I need to compute 14 multiplied by 24. Let me calculate that. 14 * 20 is 280, and 14 * 4 is 56, so adding those together gives 280 + 56 = 336. Therefore, g(0) should be 336. "

    "text": "But just to be thorough, let me double-check the steps. First, we were told that the graph passes through (24, 0). So when x is 24, y is 0. Plugging into the equation: (24 + 14)(t - 24) = 0. So 38*(t - 24) = 0. Therefore, t must be 24. Then, substituting t = 24 into the original function, we get g(x) = (x + 14)(24 - x). Then plugging x = 0: (0 + 14)(24 - 0) = 14 * 24 = 336. So that checks out. "

    "text": "Is there any other way this could be approached? Maybe expanding the original function and then using the point to find t? Let's try that alternative method to confirm. Let's expand g(x): (x + 14)(t - x). Multiplying out, we get x*t - x^2 + 14t - 14x. So, combining terms, it's -x^2 + (t - 14)x + 14t. So in standard quadratic form, that's g(x) = -x\u00b2 + (t - 14)x + 14t. Now, since the graph passes through (24, 0), substitute x =24 and y=0: 0 = -(24)^2 + (t -14)(24) +14t. Let's compute that. "

So, 38t -912 = 0. Therefore, 38t = 912. Divide both sides by 38: t = 912 /38. Let me compute that. 38*24 = 912, so t =24. So same result. Therefore, t is indeed 24. Then, as before, g(0) is (0 +14)(24 -0)=14*24=336. So both methods confirm that t is 24 and g(0)=336. "

Then substituting x=24: -24\u00b2 +24(t -14) +14t. So -576 +24t -336 +14t. 24t +14t =38t, -576 -336 =-912. So 38t -912=0, so t=24. All right, same answer. "
