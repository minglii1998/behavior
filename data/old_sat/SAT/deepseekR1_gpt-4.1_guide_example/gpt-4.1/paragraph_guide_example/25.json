    "text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about 10 students selling a total of 90 boxes of cookies. They're asking which of the given choices can be calculated from this information. The options are A) average, B) median, C) greatest number, and D) least number."

  {
    "reason": "This paragraph methodically recalls the meanings of the terms and directly calculates the average using the given data. It is straightforward computation and reasoning toward the answer, with no sign of exploration or explicit verification.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "First, I need to recall what each of these terms means. The average, or mean, is the total divided by the number of students. Since we know the total is 90 boxes and there are 10 students, that should be straightforward. So average would be 90 divided by 10, which is 9. So A) seems possible. But let's check the others."
  },
  {
    "reason": "Here, the solver discusses what is needed to compute the median, and then explains with examples why it cannot be found from the given information. They use assumed cases not to explore possible answer strategies, but to illustrate the limitation of the data, as part of the main line of reasoning.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For 10 students, the median would be the average of the 5th and 6th values. However, to find the median, we need to know the individual values or at least their distribution. But here we just have the total. So if all we know is the total, we can't determine the median because there are many different distributions that could add up to 90. For example, maybe all students sold exactly 9 boxes, making the median 9. Or maybe some sold more and some sold less. The median could vary. So B) probably can't be calculated."
  },
  {
    "reason": "The solver applies logic to the maximum value in the given context, rules out determinability given the constraints, and walks through reasoning with examples. The purpose is to progress toward an answer, not to hypothesize a new approach.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "C) The greatest number of boxes sold by one student. Hmm. Without knowing the distribution, can we determine the maximum? Well, the maximum could be as high as 90 if one student sold all 90, and the rest sold 0. But that's an extreme case. Alternatively, if the maximum was lower, like 50, then the others would have to add up to 40. But there's no way to know for sure just from the total. So we can't determine the maximum; it could be any number from 9 up to 90, depending on how the boxes are distributed. So C) can't be calculated."

  {
    "reason": "This paragraph systematically applies reasoning to the minimum value and concludes it cannot be calculated. It follows a logical progression and explanation, reflecting the standard solution path.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "D) The least number of boxes sold by one student. Similar to the maximum, the minimum could be 0 if one student didn't sell any, and the others sold more. Or it could be 9 if everyone sold exactly 9. But again, without specific data, we can't determine the minimum. So D) is out."
  },
  {
    "reason": "This paragraph systematically checks that only the average can be calculated using the given data, applies the formula (total divided by number of students), performs the calculation, and justifies why the other quantities cannot be determined due to lack of information. The entire paragraph is direct reasoning toward the solution with confirmation embedded, but not an explicit verification paragraph or off-plan exploration\u2014it is a definitive and standard way to solve this problem.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "So the only one that can be calculated is A) the average. Let me double-check. The average is total divided by number of students, which is given. So 90/10 = 9. So yes, A) is possible. The rest require more information about individual sales, which we don't have. So the answer must be A.</think>The average number of boxes sold per student can be calculated using the total boxes (90) and the number of students (10). The average is \\( \\frac{90}{10} = 9 \\). "
  },
  {
    "reason": "This paragraph explains why the median, greatest, or least number cannot be calculated without individual student sales data. The focus is on explaining and justifying via logical reasoning based on problem information\u2014a standard part of the main solution.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "For the **median**, **greatest number**, or **least number** of boxes sold, individual data points are required, which are not provided. These values depend on the distribution of sales among students, which could vary widely even with the same total. "
