    "class": "General",
    "text": "First, I remember that percentage increase means you take a certain percentage of the original amount and add it to the original. So, if he has 60% more plants this year, that should be 60% of 35 added to the original 35, right? "

  {
    "reason": "This paragraph presents a standard, alternative calculation method for percentage increase (multiplying by 1 + percentage), applies it directly, and carries out the computation in a confident, expository tone with no signs of uncertainty or validation. It simply advances the solution using known procedures.",

  },
  {
    "reason": "The solver states the final answer, gives an intuitive contextual justification (comparing 60% to half of 35), and reasons why the result is reasonable based on estimation.
