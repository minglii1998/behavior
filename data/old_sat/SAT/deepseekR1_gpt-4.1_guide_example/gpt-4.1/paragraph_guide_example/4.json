    "class": "General",
    "text": "Okay, so I need to find the equation of a circle with radius 5 and center at (-8, 6). Hmm, let me remember the standard form of a circle's equation. I think it's something like (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h, k) is the center and r is the radius. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I recall that the center coordinates are subtracted in the equation, so if the center is (h, k), then it's (x - h) and (y - k). So the radius is squared on the right side."

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Given the center is (-8, 6), that means h is -8 and k is 6. So plugging into the formula, it should be (x - (-8))^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 5^2. Simplifying that, (x + 8)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 25. Let me check the answer choices."

    "text": "Option B is (x + 8)^2 + (y - 6)^2 = 25. That matches exactly what I derived. The center here is (-8, 6), and the radius squared is 25, which is correct since radius is 5. So B seems right."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Therefore, the correct answer should be B. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the signs. The standard form subtracts h and k, so if h is negative, subtracting a negative becomes addition. So (x - (-8)) becomes (x + 8) and (y - 6) stays as is because k is positive 6. Then radius squared is 25. Yep, that all checks out."
