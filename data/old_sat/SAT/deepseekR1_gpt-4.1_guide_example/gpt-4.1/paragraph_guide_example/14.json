    "reason": "Here, the respondent methodically calculates the cost of party hats based on the prices and quantities given, following the plan toward the solution.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "First, let's figure out how much money she spent on party hats. Each package is $3, and she bought 10 packages. So, 10 packages multiplied by $3 per package. Let me write that out: 10 * 3 = $30. So, she spent $30 on party hats."

    "reason": "The solver deducts the party hat cost from the total to find how much was spent on cupcakes; this continues systematic progress toward the answer without speculative reasoning or validation.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Now, the total amount she spent was $71. If she spent $30 on party hats, then the remaining money must have been spent on cupcakes. To find out how much she spent on cupcakes, we can subtract the cost of the party hats from the total amount. That would be $71 - $30. Let me do that calculation: 71 - 30 = $41. So, she spent $41 on cupcakes."

  {
    "reason": "This paragraph determines the number of cupcakes by dividing the remaining amount by the cupcake price, and then briefly confirms that calculation matches the step before, but the confirmation is just an embedded check within a regular step, not a separate verification process.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Each cupcake costs $1, right? So, if each cupcake is $1, then the number of cupcakes she bought would be equal to the amount she spent on cupcakes. Since she spent $41 on cupcakes, that must mean she bought 41 cupcakes. Let me confirm that. If each cupcake is $1, then 41 cupcakes would cost 41 * 1 = $41, which matches the remaining money after buying the party hats."

    "text": "Let me define variables. Let p be the number of party hat packages, and c be the number of cupcakes. The total cost is given by 3p + 1c = 71. The problem states that p = 10, so substituting that into the equation: 3*10 + c = 71. That simplifies to 30 + c = 71. Subtracting 30 from both sides: c = 71 - 30 = 41. So, c = 41. Therefore, Vivian bought 41 cupcakes."

    "reason": "The paragraph focuses on confirming the correctness of the answer with language like 'That gives me more confidence', 'let me just recap to ensure', and a summary that checks the logic and arithmetic. The main purpose is validation, so this is a verification episode.",
    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Okay, both methods give me the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 41 is the correct number. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't overlook anything. The problem mentions party hats and cupcakes, with given prices. Total spent is $71. Given that 10 party hat packages were bought, each at $3, so total for hats is 10*3=30. Total minus hats gives cupcakes' total cost, which is 71-30=41. Since each cupcake is $1, number of cupcakes is 41. All steps make sense, and the calculations check out. "

    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "No, wait, another thought. Could there be tax or something else added? The problem doesn't mention any tax, so we can assume all amounts are pre-tax, or tax is included in the given prices. Since the problem states each package of party hats is $3 and each cupcake is $1, and the total is $71, we can safely ignore taxes unless mentioned, which they aren't. So, no need to consider that."

    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "Is there a possibility of a discount for buying in bulk? The problem doesn't state any discounts, so I think we can assume each item is at the listed price. Therefore, the total cost is simply the sum of the individual items."
