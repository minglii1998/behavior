Since it burns 1 ounce every 4 hours, in 44 hours, how many ounces would that be? 44 divided by 4 is 11. So 11 ounces burned. 17 minus 11 is 6 ounces remaining. Yep, that matches the problem statement. So it's definitely 44 hours. So the answer is D."

But that's not right because the remaining wax is 6, so the burned wax is 17 - 6 = 11. So 11 ounces burned. 11 times 4 is 44. So D is correct. The other options don't make sense. 3 hours would be less than an ounce burned, 6 hours would be 1.5 ounces, which isn't 11. 24 is 6 ounces burned, which again is incorrect. So yeah, D is the right answer."
