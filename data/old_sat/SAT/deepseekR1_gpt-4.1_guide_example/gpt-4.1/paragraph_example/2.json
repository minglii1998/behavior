Hmm, I think the formula is something like adding up all the sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, maybe the perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Let me check that again."

For example, if the length is L and the width is W, then the perimeter is L + W + L + W, which simplifies to 2L + 2W. Alternatively, you can factor that as 2*(L + W). Yeah, either way, it should work."

Let's calculate that. 2*13 is 26, and 2*6 is 12. Adding those together: 26 + 12. That's 38 as well. Okay, so both methods give me the same answer. That makes me feel more confident."

Sometimes problems mix up length and width, but even if they did, since we are adding both, it doesn't matter. The perimeter depends on both length and width. So even if I had confused length with width, the perimeter would still be the same. So 13 and 6 are definitely the length and width. The choices are 12, 26, 38, 52."
