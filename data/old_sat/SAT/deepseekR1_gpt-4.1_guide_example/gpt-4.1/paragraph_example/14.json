To find out how much she spent on cupcakes, we can subtract the cost of the party hats from the total amount. That would be $71 - $30. Let me do that calculation: 71 - 30 = $41.

The problem mentions party hats and cupcakes, with given prices. Total spent is $71. Given that 10 party hat packages were bought, each at $3, so total for hats is 10*3=30. Total minus hats gives cupcakes' total cost, which is 71-30=41. Since each cupcake is $1, number of cupcakes is 41. All steps make sense, and the calculations check out. "

The problem doesn't mention any tax, so we can assume all amounts are pre-tax, or tax is included in the given prices.
