That would give me x\u00b2 = 25 - 9. Let me compute 25 minus 9. 25 minus 10 is 15, so 25 minus 9 is 16. So now, the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 = 16."

I wonder why they didn't include -4 as an option. Maybe the problem is set in a context where negative numbers aren't considered, or maybe they're testing if students recognize that even though there are two mathematical solutions, only the positive one is among the choices.
