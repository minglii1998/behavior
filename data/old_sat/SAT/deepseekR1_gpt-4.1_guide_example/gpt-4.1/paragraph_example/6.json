    "class": "General",

    "text": "Starting with the first term inside the parentheses, which is 'a'. Multiplying 2a\u00b2 by 'a'... Hmm, when you multiply variables with exponents, you add the exponents, right? So, a\u00b2 times a is a^(2+1) which is a\u00b3. Then, multiplying by the coefficient 2, so 2 * 1 (since the coefficient of 'a' is 1) is 2. So, that term becomes 2a\u00b3."

    "reason": "This continues to critically consider and reason out why another incorrect choice is wrong, demonstrating verification.",
    "class": "Verify",
