    "class": "General",
    "text": "First, let me recall what an x-intercept is. The x-intercept of a graph is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y-value is zero. So, in this context, the x-intercept would be the time (x) when the speed (y) becomes zero. That makes sense because when Sheila applies the brakes, her speed decreases over time until she comes to a complete stop."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "A) The speed before braking \u2013 That's when x = 0, right? So if x is the time after applying brakes, then x=0 would be the initial speed, which is the y-intercept, not the x-intercept. So A is not correct."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "B) The rate of decrease in speed per second \u2013 That's probably the slope of the line. If the equation is linear (since it's a line), the coefficient of x would represent the rate of deceleration. For example, if the equation is y = -5x + 20, then -5 is the slope, meaning the speed decreases by 5 feet per second each second. So B is talking about the slope, not the x-intercept. So B is not the answer."

    "text": "C) The number of seconds until the bicycle stops \u2013 Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. The x-intercept is when y=0, which is when the speed is zero, meaning the bicycle has stopped. So the x-coordinate there is the time taken to stop. So C sounds right."

    "reason": "This paragraph carefully evaluates option D by reasoning about the meaning of distance in the speed-time context, and eliminates it based on understanding the distinction between time (x-intercept) and distance (area under curve).",

    "text": "D) The distance traveled until stopping \u2013 Hmm, distance. If we're talking about the area under the speed-time graph, that would be the distance. But the x-intercept is just a time value. To get distance, you would need to integrate the speed over time or calculate the area under the curve. Since the x-intercept is a time (x is in seconds), D talks about feet, which is distance, so that's not it. Therefore, D is incorrect."

    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "Wait, let me make sure. Let's think of a possible equation. Suppose the equation is y = -ax + b, where b is the initial speed, and -a is the deceleration. The x-intercept is when y=0, so solving for x: 0 = -ax + b \u21d2 x = b/a. So x-intercept is b/a. "

    "reason": "Here, the model checks the units and ties the symbolic result to the physical interpretation, verifying and consolidating that b/a indeed gives the time until stopping.",
    "class": "Verify",
    "text": "What does b/a represent? Well, if b is the initial speed (feet per second) and a is the rate of deceleration (feet per second squared), then the units of x would be (ft/s)/(ft/s\u00b2) = seconds. So that gives the time until stopping. So that's consistent with choice C."
  },
  {
    "reason": "The paragraph provides a contrasting calculation for the distance, again showing why the x-intercept does not represent distance. This uses the general framework to solidify the distinction.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Alternatively, if we were to compute the distance, it would be the area under the speed vs time graph, which is a triangle. The area is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*(b/a)*b = b\u00b2/(2a). But that's the distance, which is not what the x-intercept represents. So D is distance, which requires calculation, not just reading off the x-intercept."
