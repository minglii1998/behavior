The question states that the dragonfly traveled a minimum of 1,510 miles and a maximum of 4,130 miles. We need to find the inequality that represents the possible distance, d, the dragonfly could have traveled. The choices are A through D, and the correct one should be B, but let me think through it to make sure."

The key words here are \"minimum of 1,510 miles\" and \"maximum of 4,130 miles.\" So, the distance between stopover locations can't be less than 1,510, and it can't be more than 4,130.

For example, maybe the dragonfly travels between multiple stopover locations, and each segment has a minimum or maximum? But the problem says \"a possible distance, in miles, this dragonfly traveled between stopover locations.\" So each individual segment (between two stopovers) must be between 1,510 and 4,130 miles. Therefore, each distance d is between those two numbers."

    "text": "Looking back at the answer choices: A is d \u2264 1,510, which would mean the distance can't be more than 1,510, but the problem states 1,510 is the minimum, so that's incorrect. C is d \u2265 4,130, which would mean the distance is at least 4,130, but the problem says 4,130 is the maximum, so that's also incorrect. D is 4,130 \u2264 d \u2264 5,640, which is a different range altogether and doesn't include the 1,510 minimum. Therefore, D is out. So B is the only one that correctly places d between 1,510 and 4,130."

For example, if the problem had said total migration distance, but it specifically mentions \"between stopover locations,\" which implies individual segments.
