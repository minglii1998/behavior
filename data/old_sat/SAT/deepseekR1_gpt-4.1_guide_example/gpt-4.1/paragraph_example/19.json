    "class": "General",
    "text": "First, let me recall what an equilateral triangle is. An equilateral triangle is a triangle where all three sides are equal in length. So, if AB, BC, and AC are all the same length, then triangle ABC is equilateral. The problem already gives me that AB and BC are both 4680 mm. So, if AC is also 4680 mm, then all sides are equal, and the triangle is equilateral. That seems straightforward."

These are all much shorter lengths than 4680 mm. If AC were any of these, then the triangle would have two sides of 4680 mm and one much shorter side. That would make it an isosceles triangle, not an equilateral one, because only two sides are equal. In fact, with such a short third side, the triangle inequality might come into play. Let me verify that."

    "text": "AB + BC = 4680 + 4680 = 9360 mm. AC is 468 mm. So, AB + BC (9360) is greater than AC (468). Similarly, AB + AC = 4680 + 468 = 5148 mm, which is greater than BC (4680). BC + AC = 4680 + 468 = 5148 mm, which is greater than AB (4680). So, the triangle inequality holds. So, even though AC is much shorter, it's still a valid triangle, just not an equilateral one. The same logic applies to options C and D. Those lengths, although very small, would still satisfy the triangle inequality because the sum of AB and BC is so large. However, in each case, only two sides are equal (AB and BC), so the triangle would be isosceles. Therefore, options B, C, and D would not make the triangle equilateral."

Since we already know two sides are equal (AB and BC), if we can show the third side is equal to them, then it's equilateral. So yes, option A is the right answer.
