The sample had 150 largemouth bass, and 30% of those weighed more than 2 pounds. Then we have four choices for conclusions. I need to figure out which one is best supported by the data."

Additionally, the data given is about the percentage over 2 pounds, not the average. Even if we consider just the bass, 30% over 2 pounds doesn't directly tell us the average. So B seems off."

That solidifies that D is the right answer. The other options talk about \"all fish,\" which we can't confirm with just the bass data."
