First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The function is a quadratic in terms of x, and there's a constant t involved. The graph of this function goes through the specific point (24, 0), which means when x is 24, y is 0. I need to figure out the value of t first, probably, and then plug in x = 0 into the function to find g(0). "

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Alright, step by step. Since the graph passes through (24, 0), substituting x = 24 into g(x) should give 0. Let me write that out. So, g(24) = (24 + 14)(t - 24) = 0. Let me compute that. 24 + 14 is 38, so 38 times (t - 24) equals 0. So, 38*(t - 24) = 0. Hmm, solving for t here. Since 38 isn't zero, the other factor must be zero. Therefore, t - 24 = 0, which implies t = 24. Oh, so t is 24? Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check that again. If I plug x = 24 into g(x), then (24 + 14)(t - 24) = 38*(t - 24). Since the result is 0, t must be 24. Yep, that makes sense. "

Therefore, g(0) should be 336. "

Plugging into the equation: (24 + 14)(t - 24) = 0. So 38*(t - 24) = 0. Therefore, t must be 24. Then, substituting t = 24 into the original function, we get g(x) = (x + 14)(24 - x).

So in standard quadratic form, that's g(x) = -x\u00b2 + (t - 14)x + 14t. Now, since the graph passes through (24, 0), substitute x =24 and y=0: 0 = -(24)^2 + (t -14)(24) +14t. Let's compute that. "

So, 38t -912 = 0. Therefore, 38t = 912. Divide both sides by 38: t = 912 /38. Let me compute that. 38*24 = 912, so t =24. So same result. Therefore, t is indeed 24. Then, as before, g(0) is (0 +14)(24 -0)=14*24=336. So both methods confirm that t is 24 and g(0)=336. "

Then substituting x=24: -24\u00b2 +24(t -14) +14t. So -576 +24t -336 +14t. 24t +14t =38t, -576 -336 =-912. So 38t -912=0, so t=24. All right, same answer. "
