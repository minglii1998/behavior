So, first, I remember that parallel lines have the same slope. Is that correct? Yeah, if two lines are parallel, they never intersect, which means their steepness has to be the same. So their slopes must be equal."

    "text": "So, the equation for line k is already in slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In this case, the equation is y = (1/4)x + 1. Comparing that to y = mx + b, the slope m is 1/4. Since line j is parallel to line k, it must have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line j is also 1/4. Wait, is there anything else I need to consider here?"

The only thing needed is to recognize that parallel lines share the same slope, so since line k has a slope of 1/4, line j must also have a slope of 1/4. "

    "class": "Explore",
    "text": "Another way to approach this is to think about the definition of slope. Slope is rise over run, right? So if two lines are parallel, they have to rise and run at the same rate; otherwise, they would eventually intersect. So for every 1 unit you move to the right along line k, you go up 1/4 units. Since line j is parallel, moving the same 1 unit to the right should also result in a 1/4 unit increase in y. Hence, the slope is 1/4. "

If line k has a slope of 1/4, it's neither horizontal nor vertical. A horizontal line has a slope of 0, and a vertical line has an undefined slope. Since line j is parallel to line k, which is neither horizontal nor vertical, line j must also have the same slope as line k, which is 1/4. So, no tricks there."

The key points here are understanding that parallel lines have equal slopes and identifying the slope from the equation given in slope-intercept form.

    "text": "I guess another way to look at it is by using coordinates. Suppose line k has two points, say, when x = 0, y = 1, so (0,1). Then, if x = 4, y = (1/4)(4) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. So another point is (4,2). The slope between these two points is (2 - 1)/(4 - 0) = 1/4. If line j is parallel, it must have the same slope. So if I took two points on line j, the difference in y over difference in x would also be 1/4. Therefore, confirming that the slope is indeed 1/4. "
