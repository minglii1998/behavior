So over 5 units in x, it rises about 9.1 units in y. 9.1 divided by 5 is indeed 1.82. But if the coordinates are approximate, maybe the actual points used in the line might be slightly different? For example, maybe (0,0.2) is actually (0,0) or something else. But the problem states the line passes through those approximate coordinates, so they must be the intended points for calculation. "

For instance, if the second point were (5,9), then the slope would be (9 - 0.2)/5 = 8.8/5 = 1.76, which is still closer to 1.8. If it were (5,10), then (10 - 0.2)/5 = 9.8/5 = 1.96, which is closer to 2.0. But since the given approximate point is (5,9.3), 1.82 is reasonable, and 1.8 is the closest option. "
