    "class-1": "Verify",
    "class-2-reason": "The sentence introduces an alternative method for verification by converting 5.5 to a fraction and doing the calculation; the language ('verify', 'also') and explicit mention of checking an alternative calculation qualifies this as the verification stage.",
