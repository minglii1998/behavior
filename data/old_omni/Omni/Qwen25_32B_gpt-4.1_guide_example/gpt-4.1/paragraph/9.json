    "text": "In a monotone sequence (either strictly increasing or decreasing), each choice of three distinct indices \\( i, j, k \\) with \\( i < j < k \\) will uniquely determine an arithmetic progression because the sequence is strictly ordered. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose 3 elements from \\( n \\) elements, which is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{n}{3} \\)."
