Therefore, since cos 2A ranges between -1 and 1, then (cos 2A)/2 ranges between -1/2 and 1/2. Therefore, adding 7/2, f(A) ranges between 7/2 - 1/2 = 3 and 7/2 + 1/2 = 4. But since A \u2260 n\u03c0/2, 2A \u2260 n\u03c0. Therefore, cos 2A \u2260 cos(n\u03c0) = (-1)^n. Therefore, cos 2A cannot be equal to 1 or -1. Therefore, (cos 2A)/2 cannot be equal to 1/2 or -1/2. Therefore, f(A) cannot be equal to 7/2 + 1/2 = 4 or 7/2 - 1/2 = 3. Therefore, the range is (3, 4). So that confirms again."

Therefore, cos 2A can approach 1 or -1, but never actually reach them. Therefore, f(A) can approach 4 or 3, but never actually reach them. Therefore, the range is indeed (3, 4).
