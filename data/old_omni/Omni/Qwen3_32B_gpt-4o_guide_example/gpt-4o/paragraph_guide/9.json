Similarly, if 2A approaches (2n+1)\u03c0, then cos 2A approaches -1, so f(A) approaches 7/2 - 1/2 = 3. However, since A \u2260 n\u03c0/2, 2A \u2260 n\u03c0. Therefore, cos 2A can approach 1 or -1, but never actually reach them. Therefore, f(A) can approach 4 or 3, but never actually reach them. Therefore, the range is indeed (3, 4). Therefore, the answer is (3, 4). Therefore, I think that's correct."

So no problem. So the maximum and minimum are approached but not attained. Therefore, yes, the range is open interval."
