    "text": "We need to pick a sequence that maximizes the count of 3-term AP's. Note that any three-term AP in the sequence is defined by indices i < j < k such that a_j = (a_i + a_k)/2. We want to maximize the count of such triples over all monotone sequences of distinct reals. We are asked: \"Find the maximum possible number.\" I suspect the answer is something like: The maximum possible number is choose(n,3) if the sequence is in arithmetic progression. But wait: In an arithmetic progression (like a, a+d, a+2d, ...), every triple of indices is an arithmetic progression because a_i, a_j, a_k with i<j<k, then a_j = (a_i + a_k)/2 always holds. So if the sequence is an arithmetic progression, then every triple of indices forms an arithmetic progression. But that's choose(n, 3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6 arithmetic progressions. But is that maximum? Wait, but the question says \"monotone sequence\" which is ambiguous: It means the sequence is monotone, but is it any monotone sequence, or the sequence is forced to be monotone? Usually \"monotone sequence\" means the sequence is either increasing or decreasing. But if we want to maximize the number of arithmetic progressions, then indeed an arithmetic progression is both monotone and is itself an arithmetic progression. So the answer is choose(n, 3). But wait: is it allowed? \"Three term arithmetic progressions\" means that we are counting subsequences of three terms that are in arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression sequence, every triple is an arithmetic progression. But wait: Is that maximum? Yes, because any three distinct numbers that form an arithmetic progression must have the property that the middle term is the average of the other two. But if the sequence is in arithmetic progression, then every triple is an arithmetic progression. But is that the maximum possible? I think so: For any set of n distinct reals, the maximum number of 3-term arithmetic progressions that one can have is the number of triples, because it's impossible to have more than choose(n, 3) arithmetic progressions because there are only choose(n,3) triples in total. So maximum is choose(n, 3). But wait: Is it trivial? Let's check: If the sequence is not arithmetic progression, then not every triple is an arithmetic progression. So the maximum is achieved by an arithmetic progression. But wait: But the question says \"monotone sequence\" but an arithmetic progression is monotone.

So the answer is choose(n, 3). Let's check for small n: For n=3, maximum is 1, which is choose(3,3)=1. For n=4, maximum is choose(4,3)=4, which is achieved by arithmetic progression: 1,2,3,4.
