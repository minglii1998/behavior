And equation is: a^2+b^2+c^2 + g(a)+g(b)+g(c) = a^2+b^2+c^2, so that forces g(a)+g(b)+g(c)=0 whenever a+b+c=0. So g is any function from Z to Z such that if a+b+c=0 then g(a)+g(b)+g(c)=0. But note we need that for all triple a, b, c with sum zero. But then maybe also try specific values: Let a=b=0, c=0, then g(0)+g(0)+g(0)=3g(0)=0, so g(0)=0. Let a = x, b=-x, c=0 then g(x)+g(-x)+g(0)=g(x)+g(-x)=0 for all x. So g is an odd function. Let a = x, b = -x, c=0, indeed. But what about a = x, b = 0, c = -x: same. But then consider a = x, b = x, c = -2x, then g(x)+g(x)+g(-2x)=0, so 2g(x)+g(-2x)=0, but g(-2x) = -g(2x), so then 2g(x) - g(2x)=0, or g(2x)=2g(x). That is a homogeneity property with respect to doubling. More generally, we might try to guess g is linear. Let g(x)=cx for some constant c in Z. Then f(x)=x^2+cx. And then condition becomes: f(a)+f(b)+f(c)= (a^2+ c a) + (b^2+ c b) + (c^2+ c c) = a^2+b^2+c^2 + c(a+b+c)=a^2+b^2+c^2, because a+b+c=0. So that works. And then any function of the form f(x)=x^2+ c x is a candidate. But does that cover all possibilities? Let's try a different possibility: f(x)=x^2. But that's a special case of f(x)=x^2+cx with c=0."
