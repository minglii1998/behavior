    "text": "To determine the total number of chess matches played among five students, where each student plays three matches against each of the other students, we can break down the problem as follows:"

  {
    "reason": "This paragraph methodically calculates the number of unique pairs using a well-known formula, following a clear plan.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "1. Identify the total number of unique pairs of students. Since there are 5 students, the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 5 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there are 10 unique pairs of students."
  },
  {
    "reason": "This paragraph continues the planned approach by multiplying the number of pairs by the number of matches per pair, showing direct progress to the solution.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "2. Each pair of students plays 3 matches. Therefore, the total number of matches is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ pairs} \\times 3 \\text{ matches per pair} = 30 \\text{ matches}\n   \\]"

  {
    "reason": "This paragraph presents the final answer as a conclusive statement without going into a verification process.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Thus, the total number of matches played is \\(\\boxed{30}\\)."
