    "reason": "The paragraph methodically calculates the number of unique pairs using a combination formula, which is a standard approach, showing direct progress toward solving the problem.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "1. Identify the total number of unique pairs of students. Since there are 5 students, the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 5 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there are 10 unique pairs of students."

    "reason": "This paragraph applies a straightforward multiplication to find the total matches based on the previously determined pairs, continuing the logical solution process.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "2. Each pair of students plays 3 matches. Therefore, the total number of matches is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ pairs} \\times 3 \\text{ matches per pair} = 30 \\text{ matches}\n   \\]"
