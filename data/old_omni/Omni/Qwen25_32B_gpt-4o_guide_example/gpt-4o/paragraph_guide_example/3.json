    "reason": "This paragraph initiates the problem-solving process by stating the goal and identifying the need to determine which integers n have terminating decimal representations. It is focused on setting up the problem, which aligns with the General class.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "To determine the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) over all positive integers \\(n\\) such that the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) terminates, we first need to identify which integers \\(n\\) have this property."

  {
    "reason": "The paragraph explains the condition for a fraction to have a terminating decimal, namely that n must only have the prime factors 2 and 5. This explanation is part of methodically setting up the solution process, making it General.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "A fraction \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) has a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(n\\), when written in its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Therefore, \\(n\\) must be of the form \\(2^a \\cdot 5^b\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are non-negative integers."

    "reason": "Here, the solution advances by decomposing the problem into separate sums, using known mathematical techniques. The paragraph follows a clear logical step in the reasoning process, which is characteristic of the General class.",

    "reason": "The paragraph calculates the sum of one of the geometric series, which is part of the planned solution approach. There is no uncertainty or hypothesis-testing involved, so it fits the General category.",

    "reason": "The paragraph demonstrates a step-by-step multiplication of two previously obtained results to find a product and is a continuation of organized solution steps.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "Therefore, the product of these two sums is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}\n\\]"

  {
    "reason": "The paragraph concludes the solution by clearly stating the final answer without engaging in additional exploration or verification.",
    "class": "General",
