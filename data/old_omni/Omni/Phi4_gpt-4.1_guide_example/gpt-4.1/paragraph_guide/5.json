  {
    "reason": "This paragraph proceeds to identify and calculate the number of unique pairs using the combination formula, directly moving forward with problem solving in a routine and planned fashion.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "First, consider the number of unique pairs of students. Since there are 5 students, the number of ways to choose 2 students from 5 is given by the combination formula:"

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Each pair of students plays 3 matches against each other. Therefore, for each of the 10 pairs, there are 3 matches. Thus, the total number of matches is:"
