    "text": "First, I remember that when each person plays against every other person, it's a combination problem. Because each match is between two students, right? So normally, if they only played once against each other, the total number of matches would be the number of combinations of 5 students taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So for 5 students, that would be 5!/(2!*(5-2)!) = (5*4)/2 = 10 matches. But in this case, they play three matches against each other, not just one. So maybe I need to multiply that number by 3?"

Using the formula: C(2,2)*3 = 1*3=3. Correct. If there are 3 students, each plays 3 matches against each other. The pairs are 3, so 3*3=9. Let's check: each student plays 2 others, 3 matches each, so 6 per student, but total is (3*6)/2=9. That works. So scaling up, with 5 students, 10 pairs, 3 matches each, 30. Yeah, that's solid. "
