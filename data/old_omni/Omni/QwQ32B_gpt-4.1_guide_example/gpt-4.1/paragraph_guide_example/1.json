So the boxed answer should be f(x) = x\u00b2 + kx, but since the problem asks to \"find all functions\", maybe we can write it as f(x) = x\u00b2 + c x for some constant c \u2208 \u2124, so in boxed form, maybe \\boxed{f(x) = x^2 + cx} where c is an integer. Wait, but the problem might expect a specific form, but since c can be any integer, perhaps the answer is that all such functions are quadratic functions of that form. Since the question says \"Find all the functions\", the answer is the set of functions f(x) = x\u00b2 + c x with c integer. Since they need to be presented in boxed form, perhaps they want the general form, so \\boxed{f(x) = x^2 + kx} where k is an integer. But in some Olympiad problems, they might expect you to write the explicit form, possibly with a specific constant if it's unique, but here since it's any integer, we have to include the constant."
