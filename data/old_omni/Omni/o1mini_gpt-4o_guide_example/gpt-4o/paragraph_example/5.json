    "text": "1. **Determine the number of unique pairs of students:**\n   - Since each match is between two distinct students, we first calculate how many unique pairs can be formed from five students.\n   - The number of unique pairs is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, 2) \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of students.\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\text{ pairs}\n     \\]"
