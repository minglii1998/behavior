When we canceled sin A in numerator and denominator, we assumed sin A \u2260 0, which is okay because sin A = 0 occurs at A = n\u03c0, which are excluded (since n\u03c0 = 2*(n/2)\u03c0, so when n is even, A = n\u03c0/2 would be excluded). Wait, actually the original domain is A \u2260 n\u03c0/2. So A = n\u03c0/2 includes A = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2, etc. So points where A is a multiple of \u03c0/2. Therefore, A = n\u03c0 (which are 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc.) are included in the exclusion. So sin A is zero at those points, which are excluded. So when simplifying f(A) = cos\u00b2A + 3, the expression cos\u00b2A + 3 is defined for all real numbers, but the original function f(A) is only defined for A \u2260 n\u03c0/2. However, even though cos\u00b2A + 3 is defined everywhere, the original function can't take values at A = n\u03c0/2. But in terms of range, since cos\u00b2A + 3 is continuous and can take all values between 3 and 4 as A approaches any real number except n\u03c0/2. However, even at points near n\u03c0/2, the function can approach the same limits. For example, as A approaches \u03c0/2, cos\u00b2A approaches 0, so f(A) approaches 3. Similarly, as A approaches 0 or \u03c0, cos\u00b2A approaches 1, so f(A) approaches 4. Since the function is continuous on its domain, which is R except discrete points, the range should still be all real numbers between 3 and 4.
