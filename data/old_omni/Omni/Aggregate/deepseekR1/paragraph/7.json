If we have a right triangle, then QT^2 is 4273. If we don't have a right triangle, then QT^2 would be 4273 minus 2*QU*UT*cos\u03b8. But since QU is irrational (9 sqrt33) and UT is 40, then 2*QU*UT is 2*9 sqrt33*40 = 720 sqrt33. So unless cos\u03b8 is zero, we would have QT^2 being 4273 minus 720 sqrt33 * cos\u03b8.
