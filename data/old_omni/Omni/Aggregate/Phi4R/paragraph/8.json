Equivalently, does there exist an integer solution (n, k) to the equation: k^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7. Perhaps the answer is \"No integer exists\" or \"Yes integer exists\" or \"None exists\". We want to check: \"Does there exist an integer m such that m^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7, for some integer n?\" Wait question reading: \"Does there exist an integer such that its cube is equal to 3n^2 + 3n + 7, where n is an integer.\" That is ambiguous: It might be: \"Find an integer k for which k^3 = 3n^2+3n+7 for some integer n.\" But the typical interpretation: \"Does there exist an integer m such that m^3=3n^2+3n+7?\" Or \"Does there exist an integer n such that 3n^2+3n+7 is a perfect cube?\" Which is the same question: \"Find integer n for which 3n^2+3n+7 is a cube.\"",
