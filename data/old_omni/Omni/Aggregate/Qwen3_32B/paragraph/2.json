I remember that a fraction will have a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Right? Because the decimal system is base 10, and 10 factors into 2 and 5. So, if the denominator is of the form 2^a * 5^b where a and b are non-negative integers, then the decimal terminates. ",
