Combine like terms.\nGroup the terms:\n  3 cos²A + 3 sin²A = 3 (cos²A + sin²A) = 3.\nAnd notice that:\n  cos⁴A + sin²A·cos²A = cos²A (cos²A + sin²A) = cos²A.\n\nThus, the simplified form is:\n  f(A) = 3 + cos²A.\n\nStep 3. Determine the range of f(A).\nSince cos²A is always in the interval [0, 1] for all real A, one might at first suspect that f(A) would range over [3, 4]. However, note the domain restriction A ≠ nπ/2:\n • cos²A = 0 if cos A = 0, i.e. A = π/2 + kπ (with k any integer). These A values are excluded.\n • cos²A = 1 if cos A = ±1, i.e. A = kπ. These are also excluded because kπ is a multiple of π/2 when k is even.\nThus, while cos²A can get arbitrarily close to 0 or 1, it never equals exactly 0 or 1. This means that in our expression f(A) = 3 + cos²A, the term cos²A takes on values in the open interval (0, 1).\n\nHence, f(A) takes values in:\n  3 + (0, 1) = (3, 4).\n\nConclusion:\nThe range of f(A) is (3, 4).", "o3-mini (all_token_count)": 2095, "o3-mini (thinking_token_count)": 1344}

A 3‐term arithmetic progression (AP) is a triple of indices (i, j, k), with i < j < k, such that\n\n  aⱼ – aᵢ = aₖ – aⱼ   or, equivalently,  2·aⱼ = aᵢ + aₖ.\n\nNotice that if we have an arithmetic progression in the usual sense then the three terms are “evenly spaced” (in the number line). One natural candidate for maximizing the number of these AP’s is to choose the sequence itself to be an arithmetic progression. (It turns out that no other choice can produce more 3‐AP’s.)\n\n────────────────────────────\nThe Case When the Sequence is an Arithmetic Progression\n\nAssume\n  a₁, a₂, …, aₙ  with  aᵢ = A + (i – 1)d    (with d ≠ 0)\nfor some constant A.\n\nThen for any indices i < j < k we have:\n  aᵢ = A + (i – 1)d,\n  aⱼ = A + (j – 1)d,\n  aₖ = A + (k – 1)d.\nThe condition for (aᵢ, aⱼ, aₖ) to be an arithmetic progression is\n  2·[A + (j – 1)d] = [A + (i – 1)d] + [A + (k – 1)d].\nWorking out the algebra,\n  2A + 2(j – 1)d = 2A + (i + k – 2)d,\nso we must have\n  2(j – 1) = (i + k – 2)\n    or  2j = i + k.\nThus, in an arithmetic progression, a triple (i, j, k) forms an AP if and only if j is exactly the average of i and k, which means that i + k must be even and then j = (i + k)/2.\n\n────────────────────────────\nCounting the Number of AP’s\n\nOnce the sequence is chosen to be arithmetic, every pair of indices (i,k) with i < k and i + k even produces exactly one AP (namely, with j = (i + k)/2).\n\nThus, the number of 3‐term AP’s is exactly the number of pairs (i, k) with 1 ≤ i < k ≤ n such that i + k is even.\n\nNow, when is the sum i + k even? Recall that the sum of two integers is even if and only if both integers have the same parity (both even or both odd). In the set {1, 2, …, n}:\n\n • The number of odd numbers is ⌈n/2⌉.\n • The number of even numbers is ⌊n/2⌋.\n\nTherefore, the number of pairs (i, k) with both indices odd is C(⌈n/2⌉, 2) and the number with both even is C(⌊n/2⌋, 2). Hence, the total number of AP’s is\n\n  C(⌈n/2⌉, 2) + C(⌊n/2⌋, 2).\n\nLet’s write these numbers more explicitly.\n\n────────────────────────────\nWriting the Answer Explicitly\n\nCase 1. n is even. Write n = 2m.\n • Then, the number of odd indices = m and even indices = m.\n • Thus, the number of 3‐AP’s is\n  C(m,2) + C(m,2) = (m(m – 1)/2) + (m(m – 1)/2) = m(m – 1).\n\nCase 2. n is odd. Write n = 2m + 1.\n • Then, the number of odd indices = m + 1 and even indices = m.\n • Thus, the number of 3‐AP’s is\n  C(m + 1, 2) + C(m, 2)\n    = [m(m + 1)/2] + [m(m – 1)/2]\n    = [m² + m + m² – m] / 2\n    = (2m²)/2 = m².\n\nSo, summarizing, the maximum number of 3‐term arithmetic progressions possible in a monotone sequence (of n distinct reals) is:\n  • m(m – 1) if n = 2m (even),\n  • m²    if n = 2m + 1 (odd).\n\nOr equivalently, one may simply write:\n  Maximum number = C(⌈n/2⌉,2) + C(⌊n/2⌋,2).\n\n────────────────────────────\nWhy This is the Maximum\n\nOne might wonder if there is another way to assign n distinct reals in increasing order such that there are more 3‐term arithmetic progressions than in the arithmetic progression case. The key observation is that for any increasing sequence, if a triple (aᵢ, aⱼ, aₖ) is to form a three‐term AP, then the indices i, j, and k must satisfy 2aⱼ = aᵢ + aₖ. In an arithmetic progression the relation 2aⱼ = aᵢ + aₖ is “automatically” forced by the equal spacing. In a non‐arithmetic progression, there is less “structure” and the chance that 2aⱼ equals aᵢ + aₖ for any given three indices is even smaller. In fact, one can show that the arithmetic progression maximizes the number of solutions to 2aⱼ = aᵢ + aₖ.\n\n────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of three‐term arithmetic progressions in a monotone sequence of n distinct reals is\n\n  C(⌈n/2⌉, 2) + C(⌊n/2⌋, 2)\n\nwhich can also be written as:\n  • m(m – 1) if n = 2m,\n  • m²    if n = 2m + 1.\n\nThis is the answer.", "o3-mini (all_token_count)": 3362, "o3-mini (thinking_token_count)": 1664}
