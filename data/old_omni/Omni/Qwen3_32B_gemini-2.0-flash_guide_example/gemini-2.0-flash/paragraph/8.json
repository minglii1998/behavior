Since the question is \"Does there exist...\", and the answer is \"No\", but in the format here, maybe the user wants \\boxed{0} or \\boxed{No}? But in standard math notation, you can't box \"No\". Maybe the user expects the answer to be \"No\", but since they mentioned \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe they expect \\boxed{0} if there is no such integer? Or maybe they expect me to state that there is no solution, but since the instructions are ambiguous, but given the original problem is in Chinese or somewhere else, maybe the answer is simply \\boxed{No}?"
