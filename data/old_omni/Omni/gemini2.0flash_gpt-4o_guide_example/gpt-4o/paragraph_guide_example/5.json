    "reason": "Here, the paragraph methodically applies a formula to compute a specific result (the number of pairs) and determines the total matches by multiplying by the number of matches per pair, efficiently advancing the solution with known calculations.",

    "text": "The number of pairs of students is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$.\nEach pair of students plays 3 matches against each other.\nSo the total number of matches played is the number of pairs of students multiplied by the number of matches played per pair.\nTotal number of matches = (number of pairs) $\\times$ (number of matches per pair)\nTotal number of matches = $\\binom{5}{2} \\times 3 = 10 \\times 3 = 30$."
