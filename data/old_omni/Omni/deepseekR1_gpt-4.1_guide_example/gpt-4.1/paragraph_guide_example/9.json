Therefore, A = n\u03c0 (which are 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc.) are included in the exclusion. So sin A is zero at those points, which are excluded. So when simplifying f(A) = cos\u00b2A + 3, the expression cos\u00b2A + 3 is defined for all real numbers, but the original function f(A) is only defined for A \u2260 n\u03c0/2.

However, even at points near n\u03c0/2, the function can approach the same limits. For example, as A approaches \u03c0/2, cos\u00b2A approaches 0, so f(A) approaches 3. Similarly, as A approaches 0 or \u03c0, cos\u00b2A approaches 1, so f(A) approaches 4.

So even though A = 0 is excluded, the function can get arbitrarily close to 4. Similarly, near A = \u03c0/2, the function gets close to 3.
