    "text": "First, let's think about how many pairs of students there are. Since each student plays against every other student, it's a combination problem. For five students, the number of unique pairs can be calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. Here, n is 5 students and k is 2 since a match involves two students. So, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (2 * 1 * 3!) = (5 * 4) / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10. So, there are 10 unique pairs of students."

    "text": "But wait, each pair plays three matches against each other. So, for each of these 10 pairs, there are three matches. Therefore, the total number of matches would be 10 pairs multiplied by 3 matches per pair. That would be 10 * 3 = 30 matches. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But let me verify to make sure I didn't miss anything."

If I approach it from each student's perspective: each student plays three matches against each of the other four students. So, per student, that's 3 * 4 = 12 matches. Then, with five students, that would be 5 * 12 = 60. But wait, that counts each match twice because when Student A plays Student B, it's one match from A's perspective and another from B's perspective. So, to get the actual number, we need to divide by 2. Therefore, 60 / 2 = 30. Okay, that confirms the previous answer of 30 matches."

    "text": "Alternatively, if we tried to list all matches, it would be tedious, but let's consider a smaller case. Suppose there are 2 students: each plays 3 matches against the other. So total matches: 3. If there are 3 students: each pair plays 3 matches. There are C(3,2)=3 pairs. So total matches 3*3=9. Checking via the other method: each student plays 3 matches against each of 2 others, so 3*2=6 matches per student, 3 students *6=18, divided by 2 gives 9. Which is correct."

Yep, same answer."

    "class": "General",
    "text": "Alternatively, ordered pairs: if we consider ordered pairs, there are 5*4=20 ordered pairs (since for each student, there are 4 others). But each unordered pair corresponds to two ordered pairs (A vs B and B vs A). But in chess matches, a match between A and B is the same as B and A, right? So if they play three matches, it's three instances of A vs B, regardless of order. So we don't need to consider order here. So unordered pairs, times three. Hence, 10*3=30."

    "class": "General",
