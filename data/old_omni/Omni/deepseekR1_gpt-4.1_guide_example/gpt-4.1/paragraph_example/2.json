I think a decimal terminates if and only if the denominator has prime factors of only 2 and 5, right? So n must be of the form 2^a * 5^b where a and b are non-negative integers. That makes sense because when you have a fraction in its simplest form, if the denominator only has 2s and 5s, then multiplying numerator and denominator by some number will give a power of 10, which makes the decimal terminate.
