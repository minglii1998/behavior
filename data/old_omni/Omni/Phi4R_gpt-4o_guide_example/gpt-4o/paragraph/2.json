So we sum over all positive integers n with n = 2^a 5^b for nonnegative integers a and b. The sum S = Sum_{a,b >= 0} 1/(2^a 5^b). But note that we need to consider n > 0. But note that n = 1 is included as 2^0 5^0. And the sum is double sum: Sum_{a=0}∞ Sum_{b=0}∞ 1/(2^a 5^b). We can compute sum as (Sum_{a=0}∞ 1/2^a)*(Sum_{b=0}∞ 1/5^b) = (1/(1-1/2))*(1/(1-1/5)) = 2 * (5/4) = 5/2. But wait check: sum_{a=0}∞ 1/2^a = 2, and sum_{b=0}∞ 1/5^b = 5/4, product is 2*(5/4)=5/2.
