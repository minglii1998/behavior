Let's denote f(A) = [sin A * (3 cos^2 A + cos^4 A + 3 sin^2 A + sin^2 A cos^2 A)] / [tan A * (sec A - (sin A)(tan A))]. Domain: A not equal to nπ/2, i.e. A is not equal to multiples of π/2, so sin A and cos A must be nonzero? Actually, note: A ≠ nπ/2 means A cannot be integer multiples of π/2: i.e. A cannot be 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, etc. But then what restrictions? Let's check: tan A = sin A / cos A, and sec A = 1/cos A. So denominator becomes (tan A)(sec A - sin A tan A) = (sin A/cos A) * (1/cos A - sin A*(sin A/cos A)) = (sin A/cos A) * (1/cos A - sin^2A/cosA) = (sin A/cos A)*(1 - sin^2A)/cosA = (sin A*(1 - sin^2A))/(cos^2A). But note that 1-sin^2A = cos^2A, so denominator simplifies to (sin A * cos^2A) / (cos^2A) = sin A, provided sinA is not 0, but wait, note: Actually if sinA=0, then f(A) is 0/0. But domain A ≠ nπ/2, so in fact sinA =0 are allowed if cosA is nonzero? But wait, A = 0, π are multiples of π, which are multiples of π/2? Actually 0, π, etc. are multiples of π, but are they multiples of π/2? For integer n, if n=0, then 0=0*(π/2) so yes, they are excluded. So then the domain excludes sinA=0 because A=0,π,... are multiples of π/2? Actually wait: nπ/2 for n integer. For A = 0, n=0, so it's excluded. For A = π, n=2, so it's excluded. So sinA=0 is excluded. So we can simplify denominator further: Denom = (sinA*(1-sin^2A))/(cos^2A) = (sinA*(cos^2A))/(cos^2A) = sinA, provided cosA ≠ 0. But cosA might be 0? But A ≠ nπ/2, so A = π/2, 3π/2, etc. are excluded anyway. So the denominator simplifies to sinA. So then f(A) = numerator / (sinA) = [ sinA * (3 cos^2A + cos^4A + 3 sin^2A + sin^2A cos^2A )] / sinA = 3 cos^2A + cos^4A + 3 sin^2A + sin^2A cos^2A. So now f(A) = 3 cos^2A + cos^4A + 3 sin^2A + sin^2A cos^2A. Let's simplify further. Write f(A) = cos^4A + sin^2A cos^2A + 3cos^2A + 3 sin^2A = cos^2A(cos^2A + sin^2A) + 3(cos^2A + sin^2A) = cos^2A(1) + 3(1) = cos^2A + 3. Wait check: cos^4A + sin^2A cos^2A = cos^2A(cos^2A + sin^2A)= cos^2A. And 3 cos^2A+3 sin^2A = 3 (cos^2A+ sin^2A)= 3. So the sum equals cos^2A+3.",

    "text": "So the range of f(A) is 3 + cos^2A, where cos^2A can vary from 0 to 1. So f(A) is in [3,4]. But check endpoints: cos^2A = 0 is possible when cos A =0, but cos A=0 means A= π/2, 3π/2, etc. But these are excluded because domain A ≠ nπ/2, so cos^2A cannot be 0. And cos^2A=1 is possible when cosA= ±1. But then sinA=0, but sinA=0 corresponds to A=0,π, etc. And A=0, π are also excluded because they are multiples of π/2? Wait, check: A=0 is 0*(π/2)? Yes, n=0 is excluded. So can f(A) actually take 4? Let's check: cos^2A = 1 means cos A= ±1, i.e. A= 0 mod π, but A=0, π are multiples of π/2? Actually 0=0*π/2, π = 2*(π/2) so they are excluded. So the endpoints might be not attained due to domain restrictions. But the question is \"Find the range of f(A)\" given domain A ≠ nπ/2. So the function f(A) simplifies to 3 + cos^2A, but cos^2A is in [0,1]. But because the domain excludes cos A=0 and sinA=0? Let's check: Actually we need to check the original expression's domain restrictions. Original: A ≠ nπ/2. So A can be any angle except multiples of π/2. So what values of cos^2A occur for A that are not multiples of π/2? For A not equal to nπ/2, sinA is nonzero if n is even? Wait, if n=0, A=0, sin0=0, so that's excluded. For n odd, like π/2, cos=0 so that's also excluded. So the domain excludes those angles where sinA=0 or cosA=0? Actually, let's check: A ≠ nπ/2 means A cannot be 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, etc. But then cos^2A = 0 happens when cosA=0, which is A=π/2, 3π/2, etc. So those are excluded. And cos^2A=1 happens when cosA= ±1, i.e. A=0,π,2π, etc. And those are also excluded because they are multiples of π/2? Actually, check: 0 = 0*π/2, so yes. π = 2π/2, so yes. So the possible values of cos^2A that can be attained by A that are not multiples of π/2: they are in (0,1) because 0 and 1 are not attained. But wait, is it possible to get arbitrarily close to 0? Yes, if A is arbitrarily close to π/2, cosA is arbitrarily close to 0. Similarly, can get arbitrarily close to 1, if A is arbitrarily close to 0 mod π. But can we get exactly 1? For A to get cos^2A =1, we need cosA=±1, which happens exactly when A=0 mod π, which are excluded. So the range of cos^2A for A in the domain is (0,1). So then the range of f(A) = 3 + cos^2A is (3, 4). But wait, check the simplification: f(A) = 3 + cos^2A. And cos^2A is always in [0,1] for any A, but domain restrictions remove the endpoints. So answer: f(A) ∈ (3, 4). But wait, check if there might be any discontinuities: f(A) = 3 + cos^2A is continuous in the domain? But the domain is not all of R, but its image is (3,4). So answer: f(A) ranges over (3,4).",
