    "text": "Consider the first few cases for $n$ with the entire $n$ numbers forming an arithmetic sequence \\[(1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n)\\] If $n = 3$ , there will be one ascending triplet (123). Let's only consider the ascending order for now.\nIf $n = 4$ , the first 3 numbers give 1 triplet, the addition of the 4 gives one more, for 2 in total.\nIf $n = 5$ , the first 4 numbers give 2 triplets, and the 5th number gives 2 more triplets (135 and 345).\nRepeating a few more times, we can quickly see that if $n$ is even, the nth number will give \\[\\frac{n}{2} - 1\\] more triplets in addition to all the prior triplets from the first $n-1$ numbers. \nIf $n$ is odd, the $n$ th number will give \\[\\frac{n-1}{2}\\] more triplets. \nLet $f(n)$ denote the total number of triplets for $n$ numbers. The above two statements are summarized as follows: \nIf $n$ is even, \\[f(n) = f(n-1) + \\frac{n}2 - 1\\] If $n$ is odd, \\[f(n) = f(n-1) + \\frac{n-1}2\\] \nLet's obtain the closed form for when $n$ is even: \\begin{align*} f(n) &= f(n-2) + n-2\\\\ f(n) &= f(n-4) + (n-2) + (n-4)\\\\ f(n) &= \\sum_{i=1}^{n/2} n - 2i\\\\ \\Aboxed{f(n\\ \\text{even}) &= \\frac{n^2 - 2n}4} \\end{align*} \nNow obtain the closed form when $n$ is odd by using the previous result for when $n$ is even: \\begin{align*} f(n) &= f(n-1) + \\frac{n-1}2\\\\ f(n) &= \\frac{{(n-1)}^2 - 2(n-1)}4 + \\frac{n-1}2\\\\ \\Aboxed{f(n\\ \\text{odd}) &= \\frac{{(n-1)}^2}4} \\end{align*} \nNote the ambiguous wording in the question! If the \"arithmetic progression\" is allowed to be a disordered subsequence, then every progression counts twice, both as an ascending progression and as a descending progression.\nDouble the expression to account for the descending versions of each triple, to obtain: \\begin{align*} f(n\\ \\text{even}) &= \\frac{n^2 - 2n}2\\\\ f(n\\ \\text{odd}) &= \\frac{{(n-1)}^2}2\\\\ \\Aboxed{f(n) &= \\biggl\\lfloor\\frac{(n-1)^2}2\\biggr\\rfloor} \\end{align*} \n~Lopkiloinm (corrected by integralarefun)"
