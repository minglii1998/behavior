    "reason": "The response methodically applies known problem-solving techniques by labeling players, calculating the total number of pairs, and then multiplying by the number of matches per pair to find the total matches. It presents a clear and confident approach to solving the problem using established methods.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "We label the players as A, B, C, D, and E. The total number of matches played will be equal to the number of pairs of players that can be formed times the number of matches that each pair plays. The possible pairs of players are AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, and DE. There are 10 such pairs. Thus, the total number of matches played is $10 \times 3=30$."
