    "text": "Let \\( O \\) be the centre of the top face of the cylinder and let \\( r \\) be the radius of the cylinder. We need to determine the value of \\( QT^2 \\). Since \\( RS \\) is directly above \\( PQ \\), then \\( RP \\) is perpendicular to \\( PQ \\). This means that \\( \\triangle TPQ \\) is right-angled at \\( P \\). Since \\( PQ \\) is a diameter, then \\( PQ = 2r \\). By the Pythagorean Theorem, \\( QT^2 = PT^2 + PQ^2 = n^2 + (2r)^2 = n^2 + 4r^2 \\). So we need to determine the values of \\( n \\) and \\( r \\). We will use the information about \\( QU \\) and \\( UT \\) to determine these values. Join \\( U \\) to \\( O \\). Since \\( U \\) is halfway between \\( R \\) and \\( S \\), then the arcs \\( RU \\) and \\( US \\) are each one-quarter of the circle that bounds the top face of the cylinder. This means that \\( \\angle UOR = \\angle UOS = 90^{\\circ} \\). We can use the Pythagorean Theorem in \\( \\triangle UOR \\) and \\( \\triangle UOS \\), which are both right-angled at \\( O \\), to obtain \\( UR^2 = UO^2 + OR^2 = r^2 + r^2 = 2r^2 \\) and \\( US^2 = 2r^2 \\). Since \\( RP \\) and \\( QS \\) are both perpendicular to the top face of the cylinder, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in \\( \\triangle TRU \\) and in \\( \\triangle QSU \\) to obtain \\( QU^2 = QS^2 + US^2 = m^2 + 2r^2 \\) and \\( UT^2 = TR^2 + UR^2 = (PR - PT)^2 + 2r^2 = (QS - n)^2 + 2r^2 = (m - n)^2 + 2r^2 \\). Since \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\), then \\( QU^2 = 9^2 \\cdot 33 = 2673 \\). Since \\( UT = 40 \\), then \\( UT^2 = 1600 \\). Therefore, \\( m^2 + 2r^2 = 2673 \\) and \\( (m - n)^2 + 2r^2 = 1600 \\). Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain the equivalent equations \\( m^2 - (m - n)^2 = 1073 \\) and \\( m^2 - (m^2 - 2mn + n^2) = 1073 \\) and \\( 2mn - n^2 = 29 \\cdot 37 \\) and \\( n(2m - n) = 29 \\cdot 37 \\). Since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are integers, then \\( 2m - n \\) is an integer. Thus, \\( n \\) and \\( 2m - n \\) are a factor pair of \\( 29 \\cdot 37 = 1073 \\). Since 29 and 37 are prime numbers, the integer 1073 has only four positive divisors: 1, 29, 37, 1073. This gives the following possibilities: \\( n = 1, 2m - n = 1073, m = 537 \\); \\( n = 29, 2m - n = 37, m = 33 \\); \\( n = 37, 2m - n = 29, m = 33 \\); \\( n = 1073, 2m - n = 1, m = 537 \\). Since \\( m > n \\), then \\( n \\) cannot be 37 or 1073. Since \\( QU > QS \\), then \\( m < 9 \\sqrt{33} \\approx 51.7 \\). This means that \\( n = 29 \\) and \\( m = 33 \\). Since \\( (m - n)^2 + 2r^2 = 1600 \\), we obtain \\( 2r^2 = 1600 - (m - n)^2 = 1600 - 4^2 = 1584 \\) and so \\( QT^2 = n^2 + 4r^2 = 29^2 + 2(2r^2) = 841 + 3168 = 4009 \\). The remainder when \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100 is 9."
