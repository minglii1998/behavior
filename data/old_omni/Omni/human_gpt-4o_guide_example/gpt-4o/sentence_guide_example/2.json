    "text": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n}$ terminates if and only if $n=2^{i} 5^{j}$ for some nonnegative integers $i, j$, so our desired sum is $$\\sum_{i \\geq 0} \\sum_{j \\geq 0} 2^{-i} 5^{-j}=\\sum_{i \\geq 0} 2^{-i} \\sum_{j \\geq 0} 5^{-j}=\\left(1-2^{-1}\\right)^{-1}\\left(1-5^{-1}\\right)^{-1}=\\frac{2}{1} \\frac{5}{4}=\\frac{5}{2}$$",
    "class-1-reason": "The paragraph systematically explains the conditions under which the decimal representation of a fraction terminates and uses known mathematical formulas to derive the desired sum, without showing uncertainty or conjecture. It directly progresses methodically towards solving the problem.",

    "class-2-reason": "The sentence includes a mathematical explanation and logical deductions based on the properties of the decimal representation of 1/n, sets up a formula, and performs calculations.",
