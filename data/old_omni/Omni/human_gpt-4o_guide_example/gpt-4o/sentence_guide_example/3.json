    "class-1-reason": "The paragraph methodically applies a series of transformations and manipulations to the given mathematical expression in a logical sequence, without indicating any uncertainty or hypothesizing. The focus is on applying established mathematical techniques to simplify the expression and solve the problem step-by-step, which is indicative of a General episode.",
    "class-1": "General",
    "class-2-reason": "The sentence involves performing detailed mathematical transformations, calculations, and manipulations to evaluate the given series, including changing the order of summation and simplifying expressions. This operational phase aligns with the Implement stage.",
