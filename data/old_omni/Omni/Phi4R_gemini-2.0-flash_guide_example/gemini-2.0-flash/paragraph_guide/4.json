    "text": "<think>We are asked: \"Five students play chess matches against each other. Each student plays three matches against each of the other students. How many matches are played in total?\" We have 5 students, each pair plays 3 matches. How many pairs? There are C(5,2)=10 pairs. Then total matches=10*3 = 30. However, careful: Possibly question says \"each student plays three matches against each of the other students\" means that for each pair, there are three matches. So answer: 30 matches."
