Wait, actually the original domain is A \u2260 n\u03c0/2. So A = n\u03c0/2 includes A = 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2, etc. So points where A is a multiple of \u03c0/2. Therefore, A = n\u03c0 (which are 0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, etc.) are included in the exclusion. So sin A is zero at those points, which are excluded.

However, even at points near n\u03c0/2, the function can approach the same limits. For example, as A approaches \u03c0/2, cos\u00b2A approaches 0, so f(A) approaches 3. Similarly, as A approaches 0 or \u03c0, cos\u00b2A approaches 1, so f(A) approaches 4.

So even though A = 0 is excluded, the function can get arbitrarily close to 4. Similarly, near A = \u03c0/2, the function gets close to 3. Since the function is continuous on its domain (which is R minus the discrete points n\u03c0/2), then between any two consecutive excluded points, the function is continuous, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it takes all values between 3 and 4.
