In n=4, that gives 2, which matches the previous count. Wait, but if n=5, then according to the formula for odd n, floor(n/2)*floor((n-1)/2) = 2*2=4. But if we count the consecutive triples: 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5, so three triples. Then triples with spacing 2: (1,3,5). That's another one. So total 4, which matches the formula. Ah, right!
