If I pick A approaching \u03c0/2, say A = \u03c0/2 - 0.0001, then cos A is about 0.0001, so cos\u00b2A is about 0.00000001, so f(A) is 3.00000001, which is just above 3. Similarly, approaching 0, cos A approaches 1, so f(A) approaches 4. So the function never actually reaches 3 or 4, so open interval. Therefore, yes, the range is (3,4).
