    "text": "Let $Q$, $U$, and $T$ be integers. We are given that $QU = 9 \\sqrt{33}$ and $UT = 40$.\nSince $Q$, $U$, and $T$ are integers, it follows that $U$ must be a factor of $9$ and a factor of $40$. Thus $U$ is a common factor of $9$ and $40$. The factors of $9$ are $1, 3, 9$ and the factors of $40$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40$. The only common factor is $1$, so $U=1$.\nSince $U=1$, we have $Q = 9 \\sqrt{33}$ and $T = 40$. But we are told that $Q$ is an integer. So there must be an error."

Since $Q$ and $T$ are integers, $U$ must be a divisor of 9 and a divisor of 40. The only common divisor of 9 and 40 is 1, so $U=1$.\nThen $Q = 9$ and $T = 40$.\n$QT^2 = 9(40^2) = 9(1600) = 14400$.\nWhen $QT^2$ is divided by 100, the remainder is 0."
