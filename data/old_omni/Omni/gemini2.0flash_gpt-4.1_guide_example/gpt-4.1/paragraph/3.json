    "text": "Let $n$ be a positive integer such that the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n}$ terminates. Then $\\frac{1}{n}$ can be written in the form $\\frac{a}{10^k}$ for some positive integer $a$ and non-negative integer $k$. Thus, $n = \\frac{10^k}{a}$, which implies that $n$ must be a divisor of $10^k$ for some $k$.\nSince $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$, $10^k = 2^k \\cdot 5^k$.\nTherefore, $n$ must be of the form $2^x 5^y$ for some non-negative integers $x$ and $y$."
