    "text": "Let $Q$, $U$, and $T$ be integers. We are given that $QU = 9 \\sqrt{33}$ and $UT = 40$.\nSince $Q$, $U$, and $T$ are integers, it follows that $U$ must be a factor of $9$ and a factor of $40$. Thus $U$ is a common factor of $9$ and $40$. The factors of $9$ are $1, 3, 9$ and the factors of $40$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40$. The only common factor is $1$, so $U=1$.\nSince $U=1$, we have $Q = 9 \\sqrt{33}$ and $T = 40$. But we are told that $Q$ is an integer. So there must be an error."

This is still on the mainline solution attempt, logically following implications from the setup, but not pausing to verify or test multiple alternatives. It comes across as a General episode rather than exploration because it isn\u2019t venturing off or musing about possibilities, just following technical consequences.",
