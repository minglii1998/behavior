    "text": "1. Identify the total number of unique pairs of students. Since there are 5 students, the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 5 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n   \\]\n   So, there are 10 unique pairs of students."
