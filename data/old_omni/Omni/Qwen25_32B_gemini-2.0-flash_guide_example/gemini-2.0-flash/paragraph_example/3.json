    "text": "To determine the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) over all positive integers \\(n\\) such that the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) terminates, we first need to identify which integers \\(n\\) have this property."

    "text": "A fraction \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) has a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(n\\), when written in its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Therefore, \\(n\\) must be of the form \\(2^a \\cdot 5^b\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are non-negative integers."
