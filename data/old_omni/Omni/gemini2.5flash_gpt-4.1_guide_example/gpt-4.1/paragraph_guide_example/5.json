    "class": "General",
    "text": "**Step 1: Find the number of unique pairs of students.**\nThis is a combination problem, as the order of students in a pair doesn't matter (Student A playing Student B is the same match-up as Student B playing Student A). We have 5 students and we want to choose 2 for each match.\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose."

    "class": "General",
