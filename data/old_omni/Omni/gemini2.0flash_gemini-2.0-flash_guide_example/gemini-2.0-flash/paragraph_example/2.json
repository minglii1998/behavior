    "text": "Let $Q$, $U$, and $T$ be integers. We are given that $QU = 9 \\sqrt{33}$ and $UT = 40$.\nSince $Q$, $U$, and $T$ are integers, it follows that $U$ must be a factor of $9$ and a factor of $40$. Thus $U$ is a common factor of $9$ and $40$. The factors of $9$ are $1, 3, 9$ and the factors of $40$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40$. The only common factor is $1$, so $U=1$.\nSince $U=1$, we have $Q = 9 \\sqrt{33}$ and $T = 40$. But we are told that $Q$ is an integer. So there must be an error."
