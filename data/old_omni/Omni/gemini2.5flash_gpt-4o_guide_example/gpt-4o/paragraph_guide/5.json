    "class": "General",
    "text": "**Step 1: Find the number of unique pairs of students.**\nThis is a combination problem, as the order of students in a pair doesn't matter (Student A playing Student B is the same match-up as Student B playing Student A). We have 5 students and we want to choose 2 for each match.\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose."

    "reason": "The paragraph interprets the problem statement to define how many matches each pair plays, maintaining a focus on applying given information to solve the problem.",
    "class": "General",
    "text": "**Step 2: Determine the number of matches per pair.**\nThe problem states that \"Each student plays three matches against each of the other students.\" This means each unique pair plays 3 matches against each other."
