The equation: For all a, b, c in Z with a+b+c=0, f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2.\n\nLet's try to set up some candidate forms. Let's assume f(x) = x^2 + g(x) where g is something? But then f(a)+f(b)+f(c)= a^2+b^2+c^2 + g(a)+g(b)+g(c). And equation is: a^2+b^2+c^2 + g(a)+g(b)+g(c) = a^2+b^2+c^2, so that forces g(a)+g(b)+g(c)=0 whenever a+b+c=0. So g is any function from Z to Z such that if a+b+c=0 then g(a)+g(b)+g(c)=0. But note we need that for all triple a, b, c with sum zero. But then maybe also try specific values: Let a=b=0, c=0, then g(0)+g(0)+g(0)=3g(0)=0, so g(0)=0. Let a = x, b=-x, c=0 then g(x)+g(-x)+g(0)=g(x)+g(-x)=0 for all x. So g is an odd function. Let a = x, b = -x, c=0, indeed. But what about a = x, b = 0, c = -x: same. But then consider a = x, b = x, c = -2x, then g(x)+g(x)+g(-2x)=0, so 2g(x)+g(-2x)=0, but g(-2x) = -g(2x), so then 2g(x) - g(2x)=0, or g(2x)=2g(x). That is a homogeneity property with respect to doubling. More generally, we might try to guess g is linear. Let g(x)=cx for some constant c in Z. Then f(x)=x^2+cx. And then condition becomes: f(a)+f(b)+f(c)= (a^2+ c a) + (b^2+ c b) + (c^2+ c c) = a^2+b^2+c^2 + c(a+b+c)=a^2+b^2+c^2, because a+b+c=0. So that works. And then any function of the form f(x)=x^2+ c x is a candidate. But does that cover all possibilities? Let's try a different possibility: f(x)=x^2. But that's a special case of f(x)=x^2+cx with c=0.\n\nNow let’s try: is there any possibility that g is not linear but still satisfies g(x)+g(y)+g(-x-y)=0 for all x,y in Z. And also g(0)=0 and g(-x)=-g(x). And for x=0, g(0)=0. And we already deduced g(2x)=2g(x). But can we get something like g is additive? Let's check additivity: Let y=0, then g(x)+g(0)+g(-x)=g(x)-g(x)=0, trivial. Let y=x, then g(x)+g(x)+g(-2x)=2g(x)-g(2x)=0, so g(2x)=2g(x). Let y=-x, then g(x)+g(-x)+g(0)=0. Not new.\n\nTake arbitrary x, y. The condition is: for all x, y in Z, we have g(x)+g(y)+g(-x-y)=0. That is a well-known Cauchy type equation with condition g(-x-y) = -g(x+y) so the condition becomes g(x)+g(y)=g(x+y) for all x, y in Z. So g is additive. And since g is additive and f: Z->Z, it's known that the only additive functions from Z to Z are linear (f(n)=n*g(1)). So then g(x)= kx for some integer k. So the only possible solutions are f(x)=x^2+ kx. But wait, is that indeed the full solution? Let's check: f(x)=x^2+kx. Then f(a)+f(b)+f(c)= a^2+b^2+c^2 + k(a+b+c)= a^2+b^2+c^2, since a+b+c=0. So yes, it's a solution.\n\nBut wait: But perhaps also we can consider functions of the form f(x)=x^2+ c? Let's check: f(x)=x^2+c constant. Then f(a)+f(b)+f(c)= (a^2+b^2+c^2)+3c, which equals a^2+b^2+c^2 if and only if 3c=0 so c=0. So not.\n\nWait, what about f(x)=x^2+ p(x) where p is any function with property p(x)+p(y)+p(z)=0 whenever x+y+z=0? We already found that that forces p to be additive (and odd). But as explained, the additive functions from Z to Z are linear. But wait, check: any additive function g: Z->Z must satisfy g(n)= n*g(1). So g(x)=kx for some integer k.\n\nSo then answer: f(x)=x^2+kx for some integer k.\n\nWait, are there any other possibilities? Let's check constant term: if f(x)=x^2 + c, then summing gives a^2+b^2+c^2 +3c, so then 3c=0. So c=0. But then it's same as the linear solution with k=0.\n\nNow check: f(x)=x^2+2x. Then f(a)+f(b)+f(c)= a^2+b^2+c^2+2(a+b+c)=a^2+b^2+c^2. So yes.\n\nThus the answer: f(x)= x^2 + k x, for any integer constant k. But wait, note that k can be any integer, including negative integers.\n\nBut wait: Are there any restrictions on k? Let's check f: Z->Z, f(x)= x^2 + kx. That is indeed an integer for any integer x. So answer: f(x)= x^2+ kx, for some integer constant k. But we should double-check that there is no other possibility. Let's check by plugging a=b=0, c=0 gives f(0)=0, so f(0)=0. Then let a=x, b=-x, c=0 gives f(x)+f(-x)= x^2+kx + x^2 - kx=2x^2. So that is consistent with f(x)=x^2+ kx. Yes.\n\nDouble-check: Let a=1, b=2, c=-3. f(1)+f(2)+f(-3)= (1+ k) + (4+2k) + (9-3k)=14, and 1^2+2^2+(-3)^2= 1+4+9=14. So yes.\n\nSo answer: f(x)= x^2 + k x, for any integer k.\n\nI want to consider potential non-linear solution: f(x)= x^2+g(x), with g additive. But as argued, g(x)= kx for all x. So that is it.\n\nI should check the domain: f: Z-> Z. f(x)= x^2+ kx. That is indeed the answer.\n\nI must mention that f(0)=0. f is determined by f(1)= 1 + k. So answer: All such functions are given by f(n)= n^2 + n * f(1)-1, wait, careful: if we let c = f(1)-1, then f(n)= n^2+ n*(f(1)-1). But it's simpler: Let k be any integer and define f(x)= x^2 + k x.\n\nBut I need to check: f(x)= x^2+ k x is clearly the complete set. So answer: f(x)= x^2+ k x for an arbitrary integer k.\n\nLet me check possibility: f(x)= x^2+ k x + C. But then f(0)=C must equal 0 because of a=0, b=0, c=0. So constant term is forced to be 0.\n\nThus answer: f(x)= x^2+ k x, where k is any integer.\n\nI can also check: f is determined by its behavior on two points.\n\nI might consider the possibility of \"wild\" additive functions from Z to Z. But there is no \"wild\" additive function because Z is a free abelian group of countable rank, but additive functions from Z to Z are always linear. Actually, more precisely, any group homomorphism from Z to Z is given by multiplication by an integer, so g(n)= n*g(1).\n\nThus answer: f(x)= x^2+cx, where c is any integer.\n\nThus answer: f(n)= n^2+ cn for any constant c in Z.\n\nThus answer: f(x)=x^2+cx for all x in Z.\n\nThus answer: The set of all solutions is { f: Z->Z such that f(x)= x^2 + k x for some integer k }.\n\nI must now produce final answer. We'll produce a final answer.\n\nThus answer: f(n)= n^2+kn for some integer k.\n\nI must also check possibility: f(1)= 1+k, but then f(-1)= 1- k, and summing them gives 2.\n\nI must now produce final answer message.\n\nI'll produce final answer in plain text with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer message.\n\nI'll produce final answer message.\n\nI'll produce final answer message.</think>We wish to find all functions f from the integers to the integers such that for all integers a, b, and c with\n\n  a + b + c = 0\n\nthe equation\n\n  f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = a² + b² + c²\n\nholds.\n\nStep 1. Write f(x) in a suggestive form.\n\nSince the right‐hand side of the equation is a sum of squares, it is natural to try a function of the form\n\n  f(x) = x² + g(x),\n\nwhere g is some function from ℤ to ℤ. Substituting this into the equation gives\n\n  [a² + g(a)] + [b² + g(b)] + [c² + g(c)] = a² + b² + c².\n\nCancelling the quadratic terms we obtain\n\n  g(a) + g(b) + g(c) = 0  whenever  a + b + c = 0.\n\nStep 2. Analyze the condition on g.\n\nWe need g: ℤ → ℤ such that for all integers a, b, c with a + b + c = 0, the sum g(a) + g(b) + g(c) = 0. Notice:\n\n• If we take a = b = c = 0, then\n  g(0) + g(0) + g(0) = 3g(0) = 0  ⇒  g(0) = 0.\n\n• If we take a = x, b = -x, c = 0 (since x + (–x) + 0 = 0), then\n  g(x) + g(–x) + g(0) = g(x) + g(–x) = 0.\nThus, g(–x) = –g(x), which means g is an odd function.\n\nNow, let’s take a = x, b = y, and c = –x – y (since x + y + (–x – y) = 0). Then the condition becomes\n\n  g(x) + g(y) + g(–x – y) = 0.\nBut since g is odd, g(–x – y) = –g(x + y). Hence, we have\n\n  g(x) + g(y) – g(x + y) = 0  or  g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y).\n\nThis is Cauchy’s functional equation on the integers. It is well known that every solution g: ℤ → ℤ to this equation is linear; that is, there exists an integer k such that\n\n  g(x) = kx  for all integers x.\n\nStep 3. Write the final form of f.\n\nRecall that f(x) = x² + g(x) and we have just found that g(x) = kx for some integer k. Therefore,\n\n  f(x) = x² + kx  for some integer k.\n\nVerification:\n\nFor any integers a, b, and c with a + b + c = 0, we have\n  f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = (a² + ka) + (b² + kb) + (c² + kc)\n               = (a² + b² + c²) + k(a + b + c)\n               = a² + b² + c²  (since a + b + c = 0).\n\nThus, the function satisfies the given condition.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nThe functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy\n  f(a) + f(b) + f(c) = a² + b² + c²  whenever a + b + c = 0\nare exactly those of the form\n\n  f(x) = x² + kx  for some integer k."}

We can compute sum as (Sum_{a=0}∞ 1/2^a)*(Sum_{b=0}∞ 1/5^b) = (1/(1-1/2))*(1/(1-1/5)) = 2 * (5/4) = 5/2. But wait check: sum_{a=0}∞ 1/2^a = 2, and sum_{b=0}∞ 1/5^b = 5/4, product is 2*(5/4)=5/2.

There's an identity: n^4+4 = (n^2 - 2n+2)(n^2+2n+2) = (n^2+2n+2)(n^2-2n+2). So maybe we can do partial fractions decomposition.\n\nI can attempt to write: n/(n^4+4)= n/[(n^2-2n+2)(n^2+2n+2)]. Then partial fractions might be represented in the form: something like: n/(n^4+4)= (A n+B)/(n^2-2n+2) + (C n+D)/(n^2+2n+2). Multiply both sides by the denominator gives:\n\nn = (A n+B)(n^2+2n+2) + (C n+D)(n^2-2n+2).\n\nWe want to solve for A, B, C, D.\n\nExpanding: (A n+B)(n^2+2n+2) = A n*(n^2+2n+2) + B*(n^2+2n+2)= A n^3 + 2A n^2 + 2A n + B n^2 + 2B n + 2B.\nSimilarly, (C n+D)(n^2-2n+2)= C n^3 - 2C n^2 + 2C n + D n^2 - 2D n + 2D.\nSum equals: (A+C) n^3 + (2A+B-2C+D) n^2 + (2A+2B+2C-2D) n + (2B+2D).\nThis must equal n.

Second sum: let k = n+1, then k goes from 2 to ∞, so equals ∑_{k=2}∞ 1/(k^2+1).

But they are arranged in a particular order (monotone sequence, likely increasing). The sequence is a permutation of the reals but with monotonic ordering. But the problem might be: \"Suppose we have n distinct reals arranged in increasing order. A three-term arithmetic progression is a triple (a_i, a_j, a_k) such that a_j - a_i = a_k - a_j i.e. a_i, a_j, a_k are in arithmetic progression. Count how many such triplets exist. But the sequence is monotone (increasing order, since they are distinct reals, but not necessarily arithmetic progression, but we are to choose the sequence to maximize the number of triplets that form arithmetic progression.\"\n\nWe want the maximum possible number of 3-term arithmetic progressions that can be found in a monotone sequence of n distinct reals. We are to choose the order of the n distinct reals. The sequence must be monotone, but not necessarily an arithmetic progression? But likely it's either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Let's assume it's increasing.\n\nWe want: \"What is the maximum number of arithmetic progressions (AP's) that can be formed as three-term subsequences from this sequence?\"\n\nWe need to pick a sequence that maximizes the count of 3-term AP's. Note that any three-term AP in the sequence is defined by indices i < j < k such that a_j = (a_i + a_k)/2. We want to maximize the count of such triples over all monotone sequences of distinct reals. We are asked: \"Find the maximum possible number.\" I suspect the answer is something like: The maximum possible number is choose(n,3) if the sequence is in arithmetic progression. But wait: In an arithmetic progression (like a, a+d, a+2d, ...), every triple of indices is an arithmetic progression because a_i, a_j, a_k with i<j<k, then a_j = (a_i + a_k)/2 always holds. So if the sequence is an arithmetic progression, then every triple of indices forms an arithmetic progression. But that's choose(n, 3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6 arithmetic progressions. But is that maximum? Wait, but the question says \"monotone sequence\" which is ambiguous: It means the sequence is monotone, but is it any monotone sequence, or the sequence is forced to be monotone? Usually \"monotone sequence\" means the sequence is either increasing or decreasing. But if we want to maximize the number of arithmetic progressions, then indeed an arithmetic progression is both monotone and is itself an arithmetic progression. So the answer is choose(n, 3). But wait: is it allowed? \"Three term arithmetic progressions\" means that we are counting subsequences of three terms that are in arithmetic progression. In an arithmetic progression sequence, every triple is an arithmetic progression. But wait: Is that maximum? Yes, because any three distinct numbers that form an arithmetic progression must have the property that the middle term is the average of the other two. But if the sequence is in arithmetic progression, then every triple is an arithmetic progression. But is that the maximum possible? I think so: For any set of n distinct reals, the maximum number of 3-term arithmetic progressions that one can have is the number of triples, because it's impossible to have more than choose(n, 3) arithmetic progressions because there are only choose(n,3) triples in total. So maximum is choose(n, 3). But wait: Is it trivial? Let's check: If the sequence is not arithmetic progression, then not every triple is an arithmetic progression. So the maximum is achieved by an arithmetic progression. But wait: But the question says \"monotone sequence\" but an arithmetic progression is monotone. So answer: \"The maximum possible number is (n choose 3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\"\n\nHowever, wait: Possibly the answer is different if we require the terms to be distinct reals, but they are distinct. So answer: Maximum is choose(n,3). But maybe the twist: \"monotone sequence\" might allow the possibility that the sequence is not arithmetic. But then the number of 3-term arithmetic progressions is less. So the answer is choose(n, 3). Let's check for small n: For n=3, maximum is 1, which is choose(3,3)=1. For n=4, maximum is choose(4,3)=4, which is achieved by arithmetic progression: 1,2,3,4. For n=5, maximum is choose(5,3)=10. So answer: \"n choose 3\" is the answer.\n\nHowever, wait: But is it always possible? Let me consider: Given any monotone sequence of n distinct reals, the maximum number of arithmetic progressions is achieved if and only if the sequence is itself arithmetic. But wait, but sometimes one might worry: \"monotone sequence\" might mean something else like \"monotonic increasing function\" and not necessarily a permutation of n numbers. But I think it's simply: \"A sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) of distinct reals that is monotonic increasing. What is the maximum possible number of three-term arithmetic progressions that can be found in such a sequence?\" And the answer is when the sequence is itself in arithmetic progression, then every triple is an arithmetic progression. So answer: \"n choose 3\" = n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\n\nThus answer: The maximum possible number is (n(n-1)(n-2))/6.\n\nWait: Let me double-check: The sequence must be monotone. But does monotone sequence include non-arithmetic sequences? Yes, but the maximum is achieved by an arithmetic progression. So answer: \"n choose 3.\"\n\nMaybe answer is: \"n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\" We can also mention that the arithmetic progression is unique up to affine transformation.\n\nHowever, wait: But are there any restrictions? Because in a monotone sequence, the terms are arranged in order. But the arithmetic progression ordering must also preserve the original ordering. But in an arithmetic progression, the original ordering is the same as the arithmetic progression ordering. So yes.\n\nThus answer: (n choose 3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\n\nBut wait: Is it possible that there is a subtlety: \"monotone\" might not allow the sequence to be arithmetic? But arithmetic progression is monotone if the common difference is positive, so that is allowed. So answer: (n choose 3).\n\nThus answer: \"n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\"\n\nWait: But some might consider the possibility of a monotone sequence that is not arithmetic: But if it's not arithmetic, then not every triple is an arithmetic progression. So maximum is achieved by an arithmetic progression.\n\nThus answer: \"n choose 3.\"\n\nSo I'll answer: \"n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\"\n\nThus answer: \"The maximum possible number of three-term arithmetic progressions in a monotone sequence of n distinct reals is C(n,3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\"\n\nI'll now produce answer accordingly.\n\nBut wait: Let me consider alternative possibility: They might be asking: \"What is the maximum possible number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in a sequence that is monotone (i.e., increasing or decreasing) but not necessarily arithmetic?\" But then the answer is the same: The maximum is achieved when the sequence is arithmetic.\n\nI should double-check: The condition \"monotone\" means either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. But if we choose an arithmetic progression with positive common difference, then the sequence is increasing and every triple is an arithmetic progression. So answer: choose(n, 3).\n\nI want to check if any other sequence can yield more than that. But maximum possible number of 3-term arithmetic progressions in any set of n numbers is indeed choose(n,3) because any three numbers is a triple. But wait: But the triple must be in arithmetic progression. But if the sequence is not an arithmetic progression, some triple might not be arithmetic. And you can't have more than the total number of triples.\n\nI can also mention: \"Thus the answer is n(n-1)(n-2)/6.\"\n\nI think that's it.\n\nThus answer: \"n choose 3.\" So I'll produce answer. We'll produce answer with explanation.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \"n(n - 1)(n - 2)/6.\"\n\nI'll produce answer. We'll produce explanation: \"Every triple in an arithmetic progression is an arithmetic progression, so the maximum is attained when the sequence itself is arithmetic.\"\n\nThus I'll produce answer.</think>We want to arrange n distinct real numbers in a monotone (say, increasing) order so as to maximize the number of three‐term arithmetic progressions (AP’s) that occur as subsequences.

Since \\( (m - n)^2 + 2r^2 = 1600 \\), we obtain \\( 2r^2 = 1600 - (m - n)^2 = 1600 - 4^2 = 1584 \\) and so \\( QT^2 = n^2 + 4r^2 = 29^2 + 2(2r^2) = 841 + 3168 = 4009 \\). The remainder when \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100 is 9.", "Correct Answer": "9", "source": "cayley", "microsoft/Phi-4-reasoning (response)": "<think>We are asked: \"What is the remainder when the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100, given that \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\) and \\( UT = 40 \\)?\". Let me restate the problem in my own words:\n\nWe have some points Q, U, T. They are presumably arranged on a line? Actually, reading problem: \"What is the remainder when the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100?\" So we are told that some integer equals QT^2. Possibly we are computing QT^2. We are given QU = 9√33 and UT = 40. But note that UT is given as 40. So maybe we are in a right triangle? Possibly Q, U, T are vertices of a triangle. There's a common notation: \"QT\" could be the hypotenuse or something.\n\nI recall a similar problem that might be from the 2018 AMC or AOPS maybe.\n\nLet me re-read: \"What is the remainder when the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100?\" So QT^2 is an integer? Possibly QT^2 is computed from the lengths of QU and UT? But note that QU is given as 9√33, UT = 40. So these segments are given. But then, what is QT? It might be a sum or difference of segments? Possibly Q, U, T are collinear? But then UT = 40. But then QT would equal QU + UT? That would be 9√33 + 40, and then QT^2 would be (9√33 + 40)^2. But that equals 81*33 + 2 * 9√33*40 + 1600 = 2673 + 720√33 + 1600 = 4273 + 720√33, which is not an integer because of the irrational part. So that's not likely.\n\nWait, maybe the points are arranged on a circle? Perhaps this is a right triangle with segments QU and UT as legs and QT as the hypotenuse? But then QT^2 = (9√33)^2 + 40^2 = 9^2*33 + 1600 = 81*33 + 1600 = 2673 + 1600 = 4273, which is an integer. And then the question \"What is the remainder when the integer equal to QT^2 is divided by 100?\" would be 4273 mod 100 = 73. But is that too trivial? Let's check: 4273 mod 100 equals 73. But the problem said \"the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\)\". That implies QT^2 is an integer. So maybe that's the answer: 73.\n\nBut wait, is there any twist? Possibly Q, U, T are vertices of a right triangle with right angle at U. If that's the case then QT^2 = QU^2 + UT^2 = (9√33)^2 + 40^2 = 81*33 + 1600 = 2673 + 1600 = 4273, and 4273 mod 100 = 73. But wait, then why is the problem worded \"given that \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\) and \\( UT = 40 \\)\"? That is all the info we need if we assume right triangle.\n\nMaybe the intended configuration is that angle U is the right angle? Perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the segments are chords on a circle? However, if we consider the typical labeling of a right triangle, the segment opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. But if UT is 40, then UT might be the shorter leg? But we are not told which angle is right.\n\nAlternatively, if Q, U, T are points in a circle with QT as a diameter? But then UT is chord. But then the given lengths are not enough.\n\nLet's re-read the problem: \"What is the remainder when the integer equal to \\( QT^2 \\) is divided by 100?\" Possibly the original problem states: \"Let Q, U, T be points on a circle such that QU = 9√33 and UT = 40. Let QT be a chord. Then show that QT^2 is an integer and find the remainder when it is divided by 100.\" But without context, the simplest is to assume that the triangle is right-angled.\n\nWait, but if we assume QUT is a right triangle with right angle at U, then by the Pythagorean theorem, QT^2 = QU^2 + UT^2 = (9√33)^2 + 40^2 = 81*33 + 1600 = 2673 + 1600 = 4273. And then the answer is 4273 mod 100 = 73.\n\nBut the problem statement \"given that \\( QU = 9 \\sqrt{33} \\) and \\( UT = 40 \\)\" may be a bit more complicated: maybe the triangle is not necessarily right, but QT^2 is computed via the Law of Cosines if we know the cosine of angle U. But we are not given any angle measure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different relation: There might be a circle with center U and radius UT? But then QT is chord? Alternatively, maybe Q, U, T are points on a line such that QU is perpendicular to UT? But then QUT is a right angle at U.\n\nWait, the notation \"QT^2\" is ambiguous. Possibly the intended result is simply \"4273\". And the remainder when dividing 4273 by 100 is 73.\n\nI want to check: 9√33 squared is 81*33 = 2673, plus 40^2 = 1600, sums to 4273. And 4273 mod 100 equals 73.\n\nIt might be too trivial though. Let me check if there's any possibility that the configuration is something like \"Given a circle with center Q, U, T on the circle such that ...\" Wait, maybe there's a misprint: \"Given that QU = 9√33 and UT = 40, what is the remainder when the integer equal to QT^2 is divided by 100?\" Possibly the triangle is not necessarily right, but there is an inscribed angle theorem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an AMC contest and the configuration is a right triangle with angle QUT being 90 degrees. That is a common configuration: UT is the tangent to a circle centered at U and QU is the radius, etc. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from an AoPS thread \"QT^2\", which equals the power of T with respect to a circle.\n\nI recall a geometry problem: \"In circle with center U, chord QT is drawn such that UT is tangent to the circle. Given that QU = 9√33 and UT = 40, find QT^2 mod 100.\" But then if UT is tangent and QU is the radius, then QT^2 = QU^2 + UT^2 = (9√33)^2 + 40^2 = 81*33 + 1600 = 2673 + 1600 = 4273, remainder 73.\n\nWait, that is the same result.\n\nBut let me check: The problem \"QT^2\" might come from a circle with center Q. But then UT is chord from U to T. Wait, what's the configuration? Possibly we have a circle with center Q and UT is tangent from U? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is exactly as simple as: \"Given triangle QUT with right angle at U, compute QT^2 mod 100.\"\n\nThus answer: 73.\n\nHowever, I'll check: \"What is the remainder when the integer equal to QT^2 is divided by 100?\" It might be 73.\n\nBut I want to double-check: 9√33 squared equals 81 * 33 = 2673, UT^2 = 1600, sum equals 4273, which mod 100 equals 73.\n\nTherefore answer: 73.\n\nI can now produce answer: 73.\n\nI'll now produce answer: 73.\n\nBut maybe I should consider possibility that the triangle is not right. But then the problem wouldn't be trivial. So I'm going to assume it's a right triangle.\n\nI recall a similar problem: \"Compute the remainder when the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 9√33 and 40 is divided by 100.\" That is exactly what we computed.\n\nThus answer: 73.\n\nHowever, let me double-check: 9√33 = approximate value: 9*5.7446 = 51.7014, UT = 40, so hypotenuse = sqrt(51.7014^2 + 40^2) which equals sqrt(2673 + 1600) = sqrt(4273) which is approximately 65.38, and its square equals 4273, which mod 100 equals 73.\n\nThus answer: 73.\n\nI can now produce final answer: 73.\n\nI'll produce final answer with explanation:\n\nWe assume triangle QUT is right-angled at U. Then by the Pythagorean theorem, QT^2 = QU^2 + UT^2 = (9√33)^2 + 40^2 = 81*33 + 1600 = 2673 + 1600 = 4273. Dividing 4273 by 100, the remainder is 73.\n\nI'll produce answer: 73.</think>We begin by noting that the problem tells us that QT² is an integer. A natural way to obtain an integer value for QT² is to suppose that points Q, U, and T form a right triangle with the right angle at U. (In many geometry problems the given segments QU and UT appear as the legs of a right triangle, so that the hypotenuse QT satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.)\n\nStep 1. Write down the given lengths:\n  QU = 9√33  and  UT = 40.\n\nStep 2. Use the Pythagorean theorem:\n  QT² = (QU)² + (UT)².\n\nStep 3. Compute (QU)²:\n  (9√33)² = 9² × 33 = 81 × 33 = 2673.\n\nStep 4. Compute (UT)²:\n  40² = 1600.\n\nStep 5. Add the two results:\n  QT² = 2673 + 1600 = 4273.\n\nStep 6. Find the remainder when 4273 is divided by 100:\n  4273 divided by 100 gives a quotient of 42 and a remainder of 73.\n\nThus, the remainder when QT² is divided by 100 is 73."}

Equivalently, does there exist an integer solution (n, k) to the equation: k^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7. Perhaps the answer is \"No integer exists\" or \"Yes integer exists\" or \"None exists\". We want to check: \"Does there exist an integer m such that m^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7, for some integer n?\" Wait question reading: \"Does there exist an integer such that its cube is equal to 3n^2 + 3n + 7, where n is an integer.\" That is ambiguous: It might be: \"Find an integer k for which k^3 = 3n^2+3n+7 for some integer n.\" But the typical interpretation: \"Does there exist an integer m such that m^3=3n^2+3n+7?\" Or \"Does there exist an integer n such that 3n^2+3n+7 is a perfect cube?\" Which is the same question: \"Find integer n for which 3n^2+3n+7 is a cube.\"\n\nLet's attempt to solve: Let k^3 = 3n^2+3n+7. We want to find integer n such that the expression on right is a perfect cube.\n\nWe can attempt mod arithmetic. Let's denote n mod something. Check small n values to see if 3n^2+3n+7 yields a cube. Let's compute: For n=0, 3*0^2+3*0+7 = 7, not a cube. n=1: 3+3+7=13, not a cube. n= -1: 3+ -3+7 = 7, not cube. n=2: 3*4+6+7=12+6+7=25, not cube. n= -2: 3*4 -6+7 = 12-6+7=13, not cube. n=3: 27+9+7=43, not cube. n=-3: 27-9+7=25, not cube. n=4: 48+12+7=67, not cube. n=-4: 48-12+7=43, not cube. n=5: 75+15+7=97, not cube. n=-5: 75-15+7=67, not cube. n=6: 108+18+7=133, not cube. n=-6: 108-18+7=97, not cube. n=7: 147+21+7=175, not cube. n=-7: 147-21+7=133, not cube. n=8: 192+24+7=223, not cube. n=-8: 192-24+7=175, not cube. n=9: 243+27+7=277, not cube. n=-9: 243-27+7=223, not cube.\n\nMaybe we can solve equation as: k^3 = 3n^2+3n+7 = 3n^2+3n+1+6 = 3n(n+1) + 7 = 3n^2+3n+7. The expression 3n^2+3n+7 is quadratic in n, and we want it to be a cube. As n grows large, k ~ cube root of (3n^2) ~ n^(2/3) which is not an integer polynomial. But the question is existence of integer solution. We can try mod analysis.\n\nLet's check mod 9 perhaps. We want k^3 = 3n^2+3n+7 mod some modulus. Let's check mod 9: cubes mod 9 are: 0^3=0,1^3=1,2^3=8,3^3=0,4^3=64 mod9=1, 5^3=125 mod9=8, 6^3=216 mod9=0,7^3=343 mod9=343-342=1, 8^3=512 mod9=512-513= -1 mod9=8 mod9. So cubes mod9 are either 0,1,8. Now 3n^2+3n+7 mod9. Let n mod 9 be 0,...,8, compute:\n\nFor n=0: 3*0+0+7=7 mod9, not in {0,1,8}. For n=1: 3+3+7=13 mod9=4 mod9, not allowed. For n=2: 3*4+6+7=12+6+7=25 mod9=7 mod9, no. For n=3: 3*9+9+7=27+9+7=43 mod9=43-36=7 mod9, no. For n=4: 3*16+12+7=48+12+7=67 mod9=67-63=4 mod9, no. For n=5: 3*25+15+7=75+15+7=97 mod9=97-90=7 mod9, no. For n=6: 3*36+18+7=108+18+7=133 mod9=133-126=7 mod9, no. For n=7: 3*49+21+7=147+21+7=175 mod9=175-171=4 mod9, no. For n=8: 3*64+24+7=192+24+7=223 mod9=223-216=7 mod9, no.\n\nSo possible residues mod9 for 3n^2+3n+7 are always 7 or 4 mod9. Cubes mod9 are 0,1,8 mod9. But 7 and 4 mod9 are not in the set {0,1,8}. So no solutions exist mod9, i.e. the equation k^3 = 3n^2+3n+7 has no solutions in integers. But wait, check mod3: The expression 3n^2+3n+7 mod3: 3n^2+3n is divisible by3, so equals 7 mod3=1 mod3. Cubes mod3: 0^3=0, 1^3=1, 2^3=8 mod3=2. So possible cube residues mod3 are 0,1,2. So mod3 doesn't rule out solution. But mod9 does. We computed for all n mod9, the value 3n^2+3n+7 gives either 7 or 4 mod9. And cubes mod9 can only be 0,1,8 mod9. So no equality is possible. Wait check: 4 mod9 vs cubes: cubes mod9: 0, 1,8. They are 0,1,8. 4 is not among them, 7 is not among them. So there is no solution.\n\nBut we need to double-check. Let n mod9 = 0 gives: 3*0+0+7=7 mod9, but possible cubes mod9: 1^3=1,2^3=8, 4^3=64 mod9=64 mod9=64-63=1, 5^3=125 mod9=125-117=8, 7^3=343 mod9=343-342=1, 8^3=512 mod9=512-513= -1 mod9=8. So yes. So answer: No integer n exists such that 3n^2+3n+7 is a perfect cube.\n\nBut wait: The problem wording: \"Does there exist an integer such that its cube is equal to 3n^2 + 3n + 7, where n is an integer.\" Could be interpreted as: \"Find an integer m such that m^3 = 3n^2+3n+7 for some integer n.\" And answer is: \"No such integer exists because mod9 analysis yields a contradiction.\" Possibly answer: \"No.\"\n\nI must produce a complete explanation.\n\nI can write: \"Suppose m^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7 for some integers m and n. Then consider the congruence mod 9. The cubes modulo 9 are 0,1,8. On the other hand, 3n^2+3n is divisible by 3, so we have m^3 = 3n^2+3n+7 ≡ 7 (mod3) or mod9. But more carefully: Evaluate 3n^2+3n mod9 for all residues n mod9. One finds that for any n, 3n^2+3n+7 is congruent to either 4 or 7 modulo 9. But 4 and 7 are not among the possible residues of cubes mod9. Therefore, no such integer m exists.\"\n\nWait, wait: \"n is an integer\" - it means \"n\" is arbitrary integer. \"Does there exist an integer such that its cube equals that expression?\" Possibly the answer is \"No.\"\n\nBut I must double-check mod9: For any integer n, n mod9 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Then 3n^2+3n mod9 is 3*(n^2+n) mod9. But note: n^2+n = n(n+1) is always even, but not necessarily 0 mod something. Let me recalc manually:\n\nn mod9=0: 3*0+0+7=7 mod9.\nn=1: 3*1+3+7=3+3+7=13 mod9=4.\nn=2: 3*4+6+7=12+6+7=25 mod9=25-18=7.\nn=3: 3*9+9+7=27+9+7=43 mod9=43-36=7.\nn=4: 3*16+12+7=48+12+7=67 mod9=67-63=4.\nn=5: 3*25+15+7=75+15+7=97 mod9=97-90=7.\nn=6: 3*36+18+7=108+18+7=133 mod9=133-126=7.\nn=7: 3*49+21+7=147+21+7=175 mod9=175-171=4.\nn=8: 3*64+24+7=192+24+7=223 mod9=223-216=7.\n\nSo indeed only possibilities: either 7 or 4 mod9.\n\nCubes mod9: m^3 mod9. m=0:0, m=1:1, m=2:8, m=3:0, m=4:64 mod9=64-63=1, m=5:125 mod9=125-117=8, m=6:216 mod9=0, m=7:343 mod9=343-342=1, m=8:512 mod9=512-513= -1 mod9 = 8 mod9. So indeed cubes mod9 are {0,1,8}. So 4 and 7 are not possible.\n\nThus answer: \"No, there is no such integer.\"\n\nI can also mention that the equation has no solutions in integers.\n\nI can provide a final answer: \"No, there does not exist an integer n for which 3n^2+3n+7 is a perfect cube.\"\n\nI must mention: \"Answer: No.\"\n\nI can add explanation: \"One can check the equation modulo 9 to show that the expression 3n^2+3n+7 is always congruent to 4 or 7 modulo 9, which are not possible residues of cubes modulo 9.\"\n\nThus I'll produce final answer.\n\nI'll produce final answer: \"There does not exist any integer n such that 3n^2+3n+7 is a perfect cube. This can be proven using modular arithmetic modulo 9.\"\n\nThus answer: \"No.\"\n\nI'll produce final answer.</think>We wish to know if there is an integer n for which\n\n  3n² + 3n + 7 = m³\n\nfor some integer m.\n\nA very effective way to show that no solutions exist is to work modulo 9.\n\nStep 1. Find the possible cube residues modulo 9.\n\nFor any integer m, the cube m³ modulo 9 can only be one of the following. (You can verify these by checking m = 0, 1, 2, …, 8 modulo 9.)\n\n  • m ≡ 0 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 0³ = 0 (mod 9)\n  • m ≡ 1 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 1³ = 1 (mod 9)\n  • m ≡ 2 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 8 (mod 9)\n  • m ≡ 3 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 27 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n  • m ≡ 4 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 64 ≡ 1 (mod 9) (since 64 − 63 = 1)\n  • m ≡ 5 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 125 ≡ 8 (mod 9)\n  • m ≡ 6 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 216 ≡ 0 (mod 9)\n  • m ≡ 7 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 343 ≡ 1 (mod 9)\n  • m ≡ 8 (mod 9) ⇒ m³ ≡ 512 ≡ 8 (mod 9)\n\nThus the only cube residues mod 9 are 0, 1, and 8.\n\nStep 2. Compute 3n² + 3n + 7 modulo 9.\n\nNotice that 3n² + 3n is divisible by 3, so we can first compute 3n² + 3n (mod 9) for n = 0, 1, 2, …, 8 and then add 7.\n\nLet’s check each residue class modulo 9:\n\n  • If n ≡ 0 (mod 9): 3·0² + 3·0 + 7 = 0 + 0 + 7 = 7 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 1 (mod 9): 3·1² + 3·1 + 7 = 3 + 3 + 7 = 13 ≡ 4 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 2 (mod 9): 3·4 + 6 + 7 = 12 + 6 + 7 = 25 ≡ 7 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 3 (mod 9): 3·9 + 9 + 7 = 27 + 9 + 7 = 43 ≡ 7 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 4 (mod 9): 3·16 + 12 + 7 = 48 + 12 + 7 = 67 ≡ 4 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 5 (mod 9): 3·25 + 15 + 7 = 75 + 15 + 7 = 97 ≡ 7 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 6 (mod 9): 3·36 + 18 + 7 = 108 + 18 + 7 = 133 ≡ 7 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 7 (mod 9): 3·49 + 21 + 7 = 147 + 21 + 7 = 175 ≡ 4 (mod 9)\n  • If n ≡ 8 (mod 9): 3·64 + 24 + 7 = 192 + 24 + 7 = 223 ≡ 7 (mod 9)\n\nSo regardless of n modulo 9, the expression 3n² + 3n + 7 is always congruent to either 7 or 4 modulo 9.\n\nStep 3. Compare the two sets of residues.\n\nThe cubes modulo 9 can only be 0, 1, or 8, while 3n² + 3n + 7 is always 4 or 7 modulo 9. Since neither 4 nor 7 is in the set {0, 1, 8}, it is impossible for 3n² + 3n + 7 to be a perfect cube.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere is no integer n for which 3n² + 3n + 7 is a perfect cube."}

Let's denote f(A) = [sin A * (3 cos^2 A + cos^4 A + 3 sin^2 A + sin^2 A cos^2 A)] / [tan A * (sec A - (sin A)(tan A))]. Domain: A not equal to nπ/2, i.e. A is not equal to multiples of π/2, so sin A and cos A must be nonzero? Actually, note: A ≠ nπ/2 means A cannot be integer multiples of π/2: i.e. A cannot be 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, etc. But then what restrictions? Let's check: tan A = sin A / cos A, and sec A = 1/cos A. So denominator becomes (tan A)(sec A - sin A tan A) = (sin A/cos A) * (1/cos A - sin A*(sin A/cos A)) = (sin A/cos A) * (1/cos A - sin^2A/cosA) = (sin A/cos A)*(1 - sin^2A)/cosA = (sin A*(1 - sin^2A))/(cos^2A). But note that 1-sin^2A = cos^2A, so denominator simplifies to (sin A * cos^2A) / (cos^2A) = sin A, provided sinA is not 0, but wait, note: Actually if sinA=0, then f(A) is 0/0. But domain A ≠ nπ/2, so in fact sinA =0 are allowed if cosA is nonzero? But wait, A = 0, π are multiples of π, which are multiples of π/2? Actually 0, π, etc. are multiples of π, but are they multiples of π/2? For integer n, if n=0, then 0=0*(π/2) so yes, they are excluded. So then the domain excludes sinA=0 because A=0,π,... are multiples of π/2? Actually wait: nπ/2 for n integer. For A = 0, n=0, so it's excluded. For A = π, n=2, so it's excluded. So sinA=0 is excluded. So we can simplify denominator further: Denom = (sinA*(1-sin^2A))/(cos^2A) = (sinA*(cos^2A))/(cos^2A) = sinA, provided cosA ≠ 0. But cosA might be 0? But A ≠ nπ/2, so A = π/2, 3π/2, etc. are excluded anyway. So the denominator simplifies to sinA. So then f(A) = numerator / (sinA) = [ sinA * (3 cos^2A + cos^4A + 3 sin^2A + sin^2A cos^2A )] / sinA = 3 cos^2A + cos^4A + 3 sin^2A + sin^2A cos^2A. So now f(A) = 3 cos^2A + cos^4A + 3 sin^2A + sin^2A cos^2A. Let's simplify further. Write f(A) = cos^4A + sin^2A cos^2A + 3cos^2A + 3 sin^2A = cos^2A(cos^2A + sin^2A) + 3(cos^2A + sin^2A) = cos^2A(1) + 3(1) = cos^2A + 3. Wait check: cos^4A + sin^2A cos^2A = cos^2A(cos^2A + sin^2A)= cos^2A. And 3 cos^2A+3 sin^2A = 3 (cos^2A+ sin^2A)= 3. So the sum equals cos^2A+3.\n\nThus f(A)= 3 + cos^2A. But careful: Wait, check: f(A) = cos^4A + sin^2A cos^2A + 3 cos^2A + 3 sin^2A. Factor cos^2A from first two terms: = cos^2A(cos^2A+ sin^2A) + 3(cos^2A+ sin^2A) = cos^2A + 3. Yes.\n\nSo the range of f(A) is 3 + cos^2A, where cos^2A can vary from 0 to 1. So f(A) is in [3,4]. But check endpoints: cos^2A = 0 is possible when cos A =0, but cos A=0 means A= π/2, 3π/2, etc. But these are excluded because domain A ≠ nπ/2, so cos^2A cannot be 0. And cos^2A=1 is possible when cosA= ±1. But then sinA=0, but sinA=0 corresponds to A=0,π, etc. And A=0, π are also excluded because they are multiples of π/2? Wait, check: A=0 is 0*(π/2)? Yes, n=0 is excluded. So can f(A) actually take 4? Let's check: cos^2A = 1 means cos A= ±1, i.e. A= 0 mod π, but A=0, π are multiples of π/2? Actually 0=0*π/2, π = 2*(π/2) so they are excluded. So the endpoints might be not attained due to domain restrictions. But the question is \"Find the range of f(A)\" given domain A ≠ nπ/2. So the function f(A) simplifies to 3 + cos^2A, but cos^2A is in [0,1]. But because the domain excludes cos A=0 and sinA=0? Let's check: Actually we need to check the original expression's domain restrictions. Original: A ≠ nπ/2. So A can be any angle except multiples of π/2. So what values of cos^2A occur for A that are not multiples of π/2? For A not equal to nπ/2, sinA is nonzero if n is even? Wait, if n=0, A=0, sin0=0, so that's excluded. For n odd, like π/2, cos=0 so that's also excluded. So the domain excludes those angles where sinA=0 or cosA=0? Actually, let's check: A ≠ nπ/2 means A cannot be 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, etc. But then cos^2A = 0 happens when cosA=0, which is A=π/2, 3π/2, etc. So those are excluded. And cos^2A=1 happens when cosA= ±1, i.e. A=0,π,2π, etc. And those are also excluded because they are multiples of π/2? Actually, check: 0 = 0*π/2, so yes. π = 2π/2, so yes. So the possible values of cos^2A that can be attained by A that are not multiples of π/2: they are in (0,1) because 0 and 1 are not attained. But wait, is it possible to get arbitrarily close to 0? Yes, if A is arbitrarily close to π/2, cosA is arbitrarily close to 0. Similarly, can get arbitrarily close to 1, if A is arbitrarily close to 0 mod π. But can we get exactly 1? For A to get cos^2A =1, we need cosA=±1, which happens exactly when A=0 mod π, which are excluded. So the range of cos^2A for A in the domain is (0,1). So then the range of f(A) = 3 + cos^2A is (3, 4). But wait, check the simplification: f(A) = 3 + cos^2A. And cos^2A is always in [0,1] for any A, but domain restrictions remove the endpoints. So answer: f(A) ∈ (3, 4). But wait, check if there might be any discontinuities: f(A) = 3 + cos^2A is continuous in the domain? But the domain is not all of R, but its image is (3,4). So answer: f(A) ranges over (3,4).\n\nWait, let's double-check: Original expression: f(A)= (sin A [3 cos^2A + cos^4A + 3 sin^2A + sin^2A cos^2A]) / (tan A [sec A - sinA tanA]). Let's simplify step by step:\n\nDenom = tanA*(secA - sinA tanA) = (sinA/cosA) * (1/cosA - sinA*(sinA/cosA)) = (sinA/cosA)* (1/cosA - sin^2A/cosA)= (sinA/cosA)*((1-sin^2A)/cosA)= (sinA/cosA)*(cos^2A/cosA)= (sinA/cosA)* cosA = sinA. So yes.\n\nThen f(A) becomes sinA*(3 cos^2A+cos^4A+3 sin^2A+ sin^2A cos^2A)/ sinA = 3 cos^2A+cos^4A+3 sin^2A+ sin^2A cos^2A = 3(cos^2A+ sin^2A) + cos^4A + sin^2A cos^2A = 3 + cos^2A (cos^2A+ sin^2A) = 3 + cos^2A.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo answer: The range is {3+ cos^2A: A not equal to nπ/2} = (3,4) because cos^2A can be arbitrarily close to 0 and 1 but not equal, because those correspond to A= nπ/2.\n\nHowever, is it possible to get cos^2A = 0? That would require cosA=0, but that means A= π/2 mod π, which are excluded because they are multiples of π/2. So cos^2A is strictly between 0 and 1. So f(A) is in (3,4).\n\nTherefore answer: The range of f is (3,4).\n\nI must include explanation.\n\nI'll write: The given expression simplifies to 3 + cos^2A. Because A ≠ nπ/2, cos^2A never equals 0 or 1, so its range is (0,1), and so the range of f(A) is (3,4).\n\nThus final answer: (3,4).\n\nI'll now produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer in text: \"We simplify the function by rewriting the denominator in terms of sine and cosine, and then note that tanA*(secA-sinA tanA) simplifies to sinA. Cancelling sinA (which is nonzero in the domain because A ≠ nπ/2), we obtain f(A)=3+cos^2A. Since cos^2A can be any number in (0,1) (since it cannot equal 0 or 1 because that would require cosA=0 or cosA=±1 which are disallowed in the domain), the range of f is (3,4).\" I'll produce answer.\n\nI'll produce answer in text.\n\nI'll produce answer in text.</think>We start with the given function\n\n  f(A) = [sin A · (3cos²A + cos⁴A + 3sin²A + sin²A·cos²A)] / [tan A · (sec A – sin A·tan A)],\n\nwith the restriction A ≠ n·(π/2) (so that sin A and cos A are never zero in the ways that would make the original expression undefined).\n\nStep 1. Rewrite the denominator in terms of sine and cosine.\n\nRecall that\n  tan A = sin A/cos A  and  sec A = 1/cos A.\nThen,\n  sec A – sin A·tan A = (1/cos A) – sin A·(sin A/cos A) = (1 – sin²A)/cos A.\nThus the denominator becomes:\n  tan A · (sec A – sin A·tan A) = (sin A/cos A) · ((1 – sin²A)/cos A)\n                    = (sin A(1 – sin²A))/(cos²A).\n\nBut since 1 – sin²A = cos²A (by the Pythagorean identity), we have:\n  (sin A·cos²A)/(cos²A) = sin A.\n\nStep 2. Simplify f(A).\n\nNow, substitute the simplified denominator back into f(A):\n  f(A) = [sin A · (3cos²A + cos⁴A + 3sin²A + sin²A·cos²A)] / sin A.\nSince sin A ≠ 0 in the domain, we can cancel sin A:\n  f(A) = 3cos²A + cos⁴A + 3sin²A + sin²A·cos²A.\n\nStep 3.

Determine the range of f(A).\n\nThe term cos²A always satisfies 0 ≤ cos²A ≤ 1 for any angle A. However, note the restriction A ≠ n·(π/2) excludes the angles where cos²A equals 0 or 1:\n  • cos²A = 0 when cos A = 0 (i.e. A = π/2, 3π/2, …),\n  • cos²A = 1 when cos A = ±1 (i.e. A = 0, π, …).\nThus, for A in the allowed domain, cos²A can take any value strictly between 0 and 1; that is, cos²A ∈ (0, 1).\n\nTherefore, f(A) = 3 + cos²A takes values in:\n  3 + (0, 1) = (3, 4).\n\nFinal Answer: The range of f(A) is (3, 4)."}
