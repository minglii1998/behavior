So, that means n must be of the form 2^a * 5^b where a and b are non-negative integers. Wait, but n has to be a positive integer, so a and b can't both be zero? Wait, no, if a and b are both zero, then n would be 1, right? Because 2^0 * 5^0 is 1. So actually, that's okay. So all n that are products of powers of 2 and 5 are the ones we need to consider."
