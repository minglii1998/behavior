But without more info, unless there is a specific triangle in mind. Wait, 9\u221a33 seems like maybe related to a 3-8-\u221a(9+64) triangle? Wait, 3-8-\u221a97? Not sure. Alternatively, 9 and 40. 9-40-? Well, 9,40,41 is a Pythagorean triple. 9\u00b2 +40\u00b2=81+1600=1681=41\u00b2. Wait a second! 9 squared plus 40 squared is 41 squared. But here QU is 9\u221a33, not 9. Hmm. "
