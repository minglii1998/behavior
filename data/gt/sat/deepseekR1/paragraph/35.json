But just to be absolutely thorough, let me check if any of the other options could make sense. Suppose someone thought that y is 5 - x, so if x is 4, then y is 5 - (-4)? Wait, no, x is positive 4. Or maybe someone thought that the system is y = 5 - x and x = 4, but solved incorrectly? For example, if someone subtracted 5 - x as 5 - 4 = 1, that's correct. If someone thought it's 5 + 4, that would be 9, which is option D, but that would be a mistake in the sign. So maybe option D is a trap for people who add instead of subtract.
