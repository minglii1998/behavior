There are 40 fourth-grade students randomly selected from a certain school. They completed a survey about the morning announcements, and 32 of them thought the announcements were helpful. The question is asking which of the given options is the largest population this survey result can be generalized to.",

When you conduct a survey, the sample should be representative of the population you want to generalize the results to. The key here is that the sample was selected randomly from a specific population. If the sample is random and there's no bias in the selection process, then the results can be generalized to the population from which the sample was drawn.",
