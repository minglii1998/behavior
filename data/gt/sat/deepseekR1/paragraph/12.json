        "text": "Hmm, let me think. The candle started with 17 ounces and now has 6 ounces left. So the amount of wax that has burned is 17 minus 6, right? Let me do that calculation: 17 - 6 equals 11 ounces. So 11 ounces of wax have burned away.",

    {
        "text": "Now, the burning rate is 1 ounce every 4 hours. So if 1 ounce takes 4 hours, then 11 ounces would take 11 times 4 hours. Let me calculate that: 11 multiplied by 4 is... 44. So 44 hours. Let me check the choices. D is 44, so that should be the answer.",

    {
        "text": "Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 17 ounces, burning for 44 hours. Since it burns 1 ounce every 4 hours, in 44 hours, how many ounces would that be? 44 divided by 4 is 11. So 11 ounces burned. 17 minus 11 is 6 ounces remaining. Yep, that matches the problem statement. So it's definitely 44 hours. So the answer is D.",

    {
        "text": "But just to be thorough, let me consider the other options. If someone thought that it's 6 ounces burned instead of 11, they might do 6 times 4, which is 24. But that's not right because the remaining wax is 6, so the burned wax is 17 - 6 = 11. So 11 ounces burned. 11 times 4 is 44. So D is correct. The other options don't make sense. 3 hours would be less than an ounce burned, 6 hours would be 1.5 ounces, which isn't 11. 24 is 6 ounces burned, which again is incorrect. So yeah, D is the right answer.",
