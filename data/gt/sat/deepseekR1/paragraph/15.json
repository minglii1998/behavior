        "text": "First, let's break down the costs. The activation fee is a one-time charge, which means no matter how many months you use the service, you only pay that $35 once. So that part of the cost isn't going to change based on the number of months. Then, there's a monthly cost of $23. That means every month, you have to pay $23, so if you have t months, you'd have to multiply 23 by t to get the total monthly cost over that period.",

        "text": "So putting that together, the total cost c should be the sum of the one-time activation fee and the monthly costs. So that would be c equals the activation fee plus the monthly rate times the number of months. In numbers, that would be c = 35 + 23t. Let me check the answer choices.",

    },
    {
        "text": "Option C is c = 23t + 35. That's the same as what I just wrote, just written in a different order because addition is commutative. So 35 + 23t is the same as 23t + 35. So that's probably the right answer. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.",

        "text": "Option A: c = t/23 + 35. That would mean the more months you have, the less you pay each month? That doesn't make sense because the problem says it's a monthly cost, so multiplying, not dividing. So A is probably wrong.",

        "text": "Option B: c = t/35 + 23. Similarly, dividing the number of months by 35 and then adding 23. Again, the monthly cost should be multiplied by the number of months, not divided. So B is out.",

The activation fee is a one-time $35, so that should be the constant term, not multiplied by t. The monthly cost is $23, so that should be multiplied by t. So D is incorrect because it swaps the coefficients.",

If I plug t = 1 into option C, c = 23*1 + 35 = 58, which matches. If I use option D, it would be 35*1 + 23 = $58 as well. Wait, hold on. Both C and D give the same result when t=1?
