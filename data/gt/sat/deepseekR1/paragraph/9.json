The sample had 150 largemouth bass, and 30% of those weighed more than 2 pounds. Then we have four choices for conclusions. I need to figure out which one is best supported by the data.",

So unless we know that largemouth bass are the only type of fish, or that other fish have similar weight distributions, we can't generalize to all fish. So A might be making too broad a claim.",
