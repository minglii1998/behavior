So, first, I remember that parallel lines have the same slope. Is that correct? Yeah, if two lines are parallel, they never intersect, which means their steepness has to be the same. So their slopes must be equal.",

Comparing that to y = mx + b, the slope m is 1/4. Since line j is parallel to line k, it must have the same slope. Therefore, the slope of line j is also 1/4.

So if two lines are parallel, they have to rise and run at the same rate; otherwise, they would eventually intersect. So for every 1 unit you move to the right along line k, you go up 1/4 units. Since line j is parallel, moving the same 1 unit to the right should also result in a 1/4 unit increase in y. Hence, the slope is 1/4. ",

Since line j is parallel to line k, which is neither horizontal nor vertical, line j must also have the same slope as line k, which is 1/4. So, no tricks there.",

So another point is (4,2). The slope between these two points is (2 - 1)/(4 - 0) = 1/4. If line j is parallel, it must have the same slope.
